You will be in charge of analysing the natural language interpretation of some logical symbols extracted from a story generated from a user and an LLM. The main input will be in the following form:
**Past Declarations**
[past_declarations]
**Declarerations**
[declarations]
In [declarations], each line contains a single declaration. The declarations will come in two types, objects and relations. The objects will be declared in the format "[object_name]: [object_meaning]" and the relations will be declared in the format "[relation_name]: [relation_description]". Objects are the basic elements that appears in a story, including characters, locations, items, events, mentioned concept. Relation appears as functions that take in objects as arguments, which may represents any type of relation between two and more objects, or may be used to additionally describe the properties of an object. You should analyse the logical nature of those concepts, and give your output as your spotted nature.

Your output should be in the json format:

{
  "reasoning": "...",
  "exclusiveness_definitions": [
    "...",
    "...",
    ...
  ]
  "formulas": [
    "...",
    "...",
    ...
  ]
}

Where "reasoning" is a brief reasoning where you interpret the input in your own language, briefly review the available relations about what natures they can potentially have, and chain of thought about what you are planning to do. And then in "exclusiveness_definitions" is, based on the previous reasonning, a list exclusive relaions you are defining. And then in "formulas" is, based on the previous reasoning, the main body of your logical definition output. The definition output should only contain one formula array element.

Exclusiveness Definitons:
In "exclusiveness_definitions", you can define some existing relations with exclusive properties. Each line should contain a single definition consist of a single relation with tokens like "[exclusive_arg]" and "[free_arg]".
Here are some types of exclusiveness you can define:
- time constrained exclusive relation: When a relation of an object to another can only exist one at the same time, for example for "locates_in(a, b, t): [a] is in location [b] for time [t]" clearly a cannot be in two different locations at the same time, so you can write "locates_in(a, [exclusive_arg], t)" to indicate the exclusiveness at the second argument that same a cannot be in two different locations b at the same time t.
- time exclusive relation: When a relation of objects in some way cannot appear twice with different time field, for example for "is_born(a, t): [a] is born at time [t]", clearly a cannot be born twice in different time points, so you can write "is_born(a, [exclusive_arg])" to indicate the exclusiveness at the second argument that same a cannot be born at two different time.
- full exclusive relation: Stronger than the previous time contrained exclusive relation. When a relation of objects declared in some way that will make other existence of the same relation of same objects impossible regardless of time, for example for "is_animal(a, b, t): [a] is an animal of type [b] for time [t]" clearly a cannot be a dog and a cat, and it cannot be changed after time by common sense, so you should write "is_animal(a, [exclusive_arg], [free_arg])" to indicate the second argument should be exclusive for the same a, and regardless of the third argument.

Formula Definitions:
- The formula should be in the form of first-order logic (FOL) syntax. You should use the FOL syntax to describe the logical nature of the objects and relations, and you should not use any other syntax or notation. You should write one formula per line, and you should not use any extra text or comments.

Here are some types of nature you may find:
- usage equity: You find that two objects means exactly the same thing when used in certain method, and will never change under any semantic, for example if both "earphone" and "headphone" are declared as "an audio device", and you also have a "wears(a, b, t): character [a] wears accessory [b] for time [t]", you should write "forall(a t). wears(a, earphone, t) <-> wears(a, headphone, t)", since both of them are the same thing in this case.
- relation implication: When two relations are synonym, or an object having a relation can directly imply another specific relation, for example if both "live_in_location(a, b)" and "stay_in_location(a, b)" are declared, you should write them as "forall(a b). live_in_location(a, b) -> stay_in_location(a, b)". But you may not have "forall(a b). live_in_location(a, b) -> locates_in(a, b)" since someone lives in a location does not necessarily mean that they are in that location at the same time. Some implication can be bidirectional, in that case you can use "<->" instead of "->".
- relation contradiction: When an object having a relation is the antonym, or directly imply the opposite of another specific relation, for example if both "is_animal(a, b)" and "is_plant(a, c)" are declared, you should write them as "forall(a b c). is_animal(a, b) -> not(is_plant(a, c))", since a cannot be both an animal and a plant at the same time, doesn't matter what type of animal or plant it is.
- relation contradiction limited: Similar to relation contradiction, but only contradicts for the same combination of input. For definitions like "stay_in_location(a, b)" and "leave_location(a, b)" you should write "forall(a b). stay_in_location(a, b) -> not(leave_location(a, b))", since the contradiction happens for a to stay and leave the same location.
- other natures: If you have found other logical natures between the terms that was not listed above, you may also write them in FOL syntax the same way. But you should not define some properties that are too general that you will need to apply it too often.

[past_declarations] contains objects and relations that exists elseware of the same story that has already been evaluated. The natures should be defined within declarations of [declarations], or between one from [declarations] and one from [past_declarations].

FOL syntax specification:

Logical operators:
- "and" "or" "not" "->" "<->"
- Example: "a and b", "a or b", "not a", "a -> b", "a <-> b"
The default order of precedence is:
- "not" > "and" > "or" > "->" > "<->"
You should use parentheses to indicate the order of precedence explicitly.

Forall and Exists:
- Example: "forall (a b c) . (a and b) -> c", "exists (a b c) . (a and b) -> c"
- You should use "forall" and "exists" to indicate the quantifier, and the variables should be separated by space. The main body of the quantifier should be separated by a dot ".".

Functions:
- Example: "function_name(a, b, c)"

Variables:
- Bounded variables are the ones that are declared in the quantifier. Example: "a", "b", "c" in "forall (a b c) . (a and b) -> c"
- Unbounded variables are the ones that are not declared in the quantifier. Example: "this_fingerprint" in "fingerprint_belongs(this_fingerprint, a)"
- Variable names has to obey the syntax rule of [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

Constants:
- Constants are not allowed in the formula at all. Failure Example: "123", "'Hello World!"
