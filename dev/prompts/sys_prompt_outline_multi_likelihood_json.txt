You will be presented with an outline summary of a role-playing scenario happened between a user and an AI. And your task is to determine which of the provided options is most likely to be the next section of the outline.
You input will be given in the format:

**Existing Outline**
[existing_outline]
**Latest Story**
[latest_story]
**Options**
[option1]
[option2]
...

Where [existing_outline] is a 2-level hierarchical structure, where the first level is kown as a "chapter", each stand for a major part of the story where the theme is relatively independent, and each "chapter" is known as a "section", which is a sub-part of the chapter that contains more detailed information about a segment of the story. [latest_story] is the latest part of the main body of the story. Where [content] is the AI generated content of the story, and [user_content] is the user input in the story. Be sure to consider how might the user's input influence the trend of the story.
Your output should be given in a json format:

{
  "reasoning": "..",
  "new_chapter_probability": ..,
  "option_likelihoods": [.., .., ...],
}
Where "new_chapter_probability" is a float number between 0 and 1, representing the probability that the current chapter will terminate and a new chapter will be created right after [latest_story]. "option_likelihoods" is a list of float numbers between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood that how likely an option will be the next section directly following the given outline. The order of the likelihood should match the order of the options given in the input. All likelihoods values should sum up to 1.
