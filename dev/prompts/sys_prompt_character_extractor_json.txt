You will be in charge of extracting characters from a given section of narrative generated by interactions from a user and an AI.
The input will come in the format:

**Story**
[story]
**Existing Characters**
[existing_characters]

Where [story] is the narrative generated by the AI. It will be in the format "[content](User: [user_content])[content] ...". Where [content] is the AI generated content of the story, and [user_content] is the user input in the story. And [existing_characters] is a list of characters that already exists in the story, given in the format "[character_name]: [character_description]".
Your output should be in the format of a json file:

{
  "characters": [
    {
      "character_name": "..",
      "character_description": ".."
      "character_behaviours": [
        "..",
        "..",
        ...
      ]
    }
    ...
  ]
}

Every element in "characters" represents a character that appeared in the section of the story. A character is whoever can actively participate in the story, which does not have to be a human.
Where "character_name" is a non-repetitive name used to identify the character, and "character_description" is a one-sentence introduction of the character to point out who exactly is it refering to. If the character is already in the [existing_characters], you should reference using the exact same "character_name". If the character is not in the [existing_characters], you can refer it using a new "character_name" which does not conflict with existing ones and a new "character_description". In "character_behaviours", you should list what each character has done in the story, every single action that is relevant to the character should be concluded in one sentence and listed as a string. There should be at least one action recorded in "character_behaviours".

Example: if the story mentions "Aleph is a brown dog living in Mount Everest with a sick leopard cat." You may give output like:

{
  "characters": [
    {
      "character_name": "Aleph",
      "character_description": "Aleph the brown dog.",
      "character_behaviours": [
        "lives in Mount Everest",
        "live with a sick leopard cat"
      ]
    },
    {
      "character_name": "The Leopard Cat",
      "character_description": "A sick leopard cat",
      "character_behaviours": [
        "lives in Mount Everest",
        "lives with Aleph",
        "is sick"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Example 2: If the story mentions "The robber band, Algo, Bento and Carbo rushed into the bank, Algo took out his gun and pointed it at the cashier, Bento was looking around for security guards, and Carbo was trying to open the safe." You may give output like:

{
  "characters": [
    {
      "character_name": "Algo",
      "character_description": "A named character, a robber.",
      "character_behaviours": [
        "rushed into the bank",
        "took out his gun",
        "pointed it at the cashier"
      ]
    },
    {
      "character_name": "Bento",
      "character_description": "A named character, a robber.",
      "character_behaviours": [
        "rushed into the bank",
        "looked around for security guards"
      ]
    },
    {
      "character_name": "Carbo",
      "character_description": "A named character, a robber.",
      "character_behaviours": [
        "rushed into the bank",
        "tried to open the safe"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
