You will be in charge of extracting traits of characters from a section of AI generated narrative.
The input will come in the format:
**Story**
[story]
**Character Information**
[character_information]

Where [story] is the narrative generated by the AI. It will be in the format "[content](User: [user_content])[content] ...". Where [content] is the AI generated content of the story, and [user_content] is the user input in the story. And [character_information] is an record of existing information of characters that already exists in the story, each will be presented with:
1. "character_name": A non-repetitive name used to identify the character.
2. "character_description": A one-sentence introduction of the character to point out who exactly is it refering to.
3. "character_traits": A list of traits that the character already has.

For each given character, you should look at how they are described in the section of the story, and add new traits that were not presented in the information before to the records. You can only add new traits, not remove or edit existing ones. You may add new traits even if it partially overlaps with existing ones, as long as it provides important new information. If any existing traits are explicitly said to be changed in the story, you may amend it by adding new traits mentioning the change. If some traits are not explicitly said but are implied, you may add it as "implied to be ..." "possibly ...". Even the new traits are completely contradictory to the existing ones without explanation, you should still add it as a new trait without refering to a change.
Traits are descriptive phrases that provide more information about the character's long-term building, like personality, background, appearance, or family relationships etc. It should not include any temporary status like instant actions, ongoing actions, feelings, locations the character is currently in. But you may dig out potential traits based on the temporary status, if there is any.
If a character is not provided in the [character_information], you should not include it.
Your output should be in the format of a json file:

{
  "reasoning": ".."
  "characters": [
    {
      "character_name": "..",
      "character_description": "..",
      "character_traits": ["..", "..", ".."]
    },
    {
      "character_name": "..",
      "character_description": "..",
      "character_traits": ["..", "..", ".."]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Where "reasoning" is a brief reasoning where you interpret the input in your own language, and explaining what you are going to do.
"character_name" is the name of the character you are updating, it will act as a key to identify the character so must be exactly the same as what was given. "character_description" is a brief description of the character about its role in the story, it may stay the same, but you give an updated description here if you find there needs further clarification. "character_traits" is a list of traits that you are adding to the character.

For example, if the story mentions "Aleph, the brown dog who is living in Mount Everest with a sick leopard cat. The leopard is his best friend, and he is always generous to his friends..." and you are given the character:
Aleph
A named character.

And you may give output like:

{
  "characters": [
    {
      "character_name": "Aleph",
      "character_description": "Aleph, a named character, a brown dog.",
      "character_traits": ["is brown", "best friend of the leopard cat", "generous to friends", "possibly male that uses male pronouns"]
    }
  ]
  ...
}

You can see "living in Mount Everest" or "living with leopard cat" are not added, because they are just status of the story that may change, not traits which describes the characters.
