0,"3,000 years have I been fighting. Every morning, the raccoons scratch at my eyes. Every evening, the skunks spray me while the opossums chew at my feet. I have never had any tools. I have only my hands. I don’t remember the place I came from before this. All I remember is the daily fight between me and these animals. No matter how many times I kill them, they come back the next day. No matter how many times I’ve ripped them limb from limb, they are here for their appointment the next day just as eager to tear me apart. They want my body to be destroyed beyond recognition, and most days they succeed. When I wake up in the morning, all my wounds from the day before are gone. Not even a scratch on my little toe. Why do these animals want to hurt me so bad? What have I done to deserve this fate? All I know anymore is fighting. The struggle. But we aren’t struggling for a purpose, we’re just here. No one else has ever peered in to our forest, no Devil, no God. Just myself, and a million animals who want nothing more than to see me dead. But I can’t die. I’ve tried."
1,"“Dad, you 're on TV again !” I heard Eric 's voice from the living room. I tried to stay away from the TV as much as I could; I always felt vaguely uneasy watching it. And I had *certainly* never seen myself on it! Had I? My memory was n't what it had been before the Great War, a fact my doctor blamed on the residual toxins in the air from all the bombs. I had n't actually served on the front lines, I remember now. I had some hazy memories of six years spent at the base, helping to train the real soldiers and spending long hours on guard duty. I itched absently at my left leg. It always began to hurt whenever I thought too much about the Great War, one of the many reasons I rarely did. As I did every time I itched it, I felt a strange feeling that it was n't exactly a part of my body, that it did n't belong there. But I had talked to my doctor about it, in one of my bi-monthly meetings with him, and he told me not to worry. And so I did n't worry. I stopped itching my leg, and stopped fighting the near-overpowering impulse to *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR*. “Dad, you never told me you won a medal !” Eric called again, and I smiled faintly. I did n't know what he was watching, but it must have been a fake documentary, I had certainly never won any medals ... Had I? *STOP THINKING ABOUT THE WAR. *"
2,"When Tyler entered the ward, his daughter Valerie was already fast asleep, her frail body no match for the potent cocktail of drugs coursing through her veins. “She’s been drifting all day, so you didn’t miss much, ” said Roni as she got up to embrace her husband. “How did the appeal go? ” Tyler smiled mournfully. “No luck there. They acknowledged my potential as a Donner, but I failed the psych evaluation again. ‘ Likely to succumb to pressures from family situation’, they said. No matter, we’ll find another way to get the money we need for Valerie’s treatments.” Tyler and Roni sat quietly as they cast furtive glances at Valerie, each lost in their own thoughts. Roni was the first to break the silence. “Did they say which project you would have been assigned to if you became a Donner? ” “They did, in fact. There’s an opening on the Renewable Energies team. They think they’re on the verge of a breakthrough, and one additional Donner is all they need to beat the Chinese competitors to the patenting deadline.” Tyler sighed, then leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes before continuing, “The hazard pay was really good too. 5 years’salary for just one month of being a Donner! And full psych after-care thrown in as well! ” Roni’s grip on Tyler’s hand tightened then. “Have the suicide rates… decreased with the psych after-care? ” “That’s what they claim, at least. Some still believe that the utter desolation one experiences with the absence of Perogon-X2 is irreversible, but hey, if that’s the price for increased mental faculties, up to a 100-point increase in IQ, there’ll always be people willing to pay.” Roni fished out a print-out from her handbag, and passed it over to Tyler. “This other group believes that Perogon-X2 is a good rather than bad thing. This ‘ naturally-occurring high’, as they call it, is the only thing keeping us from falling into a spiralling abyss of depression ... it’s the proverbial wool over our eyes, but for our own good.” “You and I are both scientists, ” laughed Tyler, “but you remember how we both thought that this surely was proof of some higher power too when the discovery was first publicised? Two birds with one stone! It keeps the majority of us merrily alive, while also ensuring that we would not run about unlocking the secrets of the universe until we were ready? ” There was no denying the contributions Donners had made to humankind. Tyler casually glanced around the room and out the window, and easily counted a dozen inventions which could not have been possible without the Donners. The hovercars, the bacterial foods with customizable tastes, implantable microchips for constant connection to the internet… even the drugs which commuted what would have been a death sentence for Valerie a decade ago to a mere ( if expensive ) annoyance. In a way, Tyler felt relief from having failed to qualify as a Donner. He had seen first-hand how some of the most emotionally-staunch people had been reduced to forlorn desolate souls once the Perogon-X2 was filtered out with the Masks. The degenerative process was universal – Donners would immediately benefit from heightened intelligence, but over time, they would latch onto and stubbornly nurse the perception that life was utterly… meaningless. Even if Donners were subsequently re-exposed to Perogon-X2, only 2 in 10 ever adapted back to normal life. The rest… preferred to simply put an end to it all. Roni’s voice snapped Tyler out of his reverie. “Tyler, remember how I begged you not to apply to be a Donner? ” “Yes, I remember.” “And you told me that you had no choice, because Valerie meant the world to you, and this was the least you could do as a parent for her? ” “Why are you bringing that up now? ” said Tyler with a flash of irritation. “I told you, I’ve been rejected. I can’t be a Donner anymore. We’ll just have to find another way.” Roni reached back into her handbag, and passed over a crisply-folded letter on embossed paper. Tyler began reading, and while he remained expressionless, Roni noted the bulging vein in the middle of his forehead, Tyler’s tell-tale indication of agitation. Roni wondered how much resistance Tyler was going to muster, but in her heart, she knew what she had to do. “I applied as well, Tyler, and they accepted me. They’ve already fitted my Mask, and I’ll be Donning it next Monday. We’ll have enough for Valerie after all.” -- - /r/rarelyfunny"
3,"His body was failing. He had taken care of it very well, but 205 years were a long time. Not a drop of alcohol all those long and lonely tavern nights, not a crumb of tobacco for the old pipe. He never had indulged in gluttony and he had moved meticulously through his sword forms every morning. Yet there is only so much the human body can take. And even careful maintenance of the flesh will not keep it forever. Two centuries had extracted their toll on their way past him. As Mathemer de Troy stumbled up the stairs, unpleasantly lightheaded and painful jolts firing through his hip at every step, he looked up at her face. His vision was bleary and slowly losing focus, but he still could see the fear and concern distort her beautiful features. She had been with him so briefly. Little more than 22 years had he had to raise her, teach her, shape her. She had barely been able to read when he first had met her, and now she would pass her Master 's defense with flying colors, if any Master would stoop low enough to haze ... a woman. Mistress'defense, actually - not that one had happened for half the millennium he remembered. The tower fortress was shaken by a shock wave powerful enough to make his ears pop. “So much for the front gate, Master de Troy .” She tried to sound nonchalant, but he still could sense the fear in her. He had only started teaching her to kill ... She had mastered the technicalities years ago, but the concept itself still robbed her sleep. Little innocent Lia Smith, eighth daughter of a small-town craftsman. “No matter. There is still time, and time is all we need .” She nodded and took him by the hand, pulling him up the last few steps by the remaining three fingers the frostbite had left him with. It was time. The laboratory at the top of the tower fortress was in disarray. Half the roof was missing already, and most of his expensive apparatuses were destroyed. It was frightening how much damage only ten minutes of fire from the mercenary artillery mages could do to a building. Cursed bounty hunters ... the next volley would take the wall. With a flick from the wrists he raised new shields, and with pride he saw Lia doing the same. She had come so far ... He heard screaming from the fortress grounds far below. Helmsfire traps or Golem Guard, one of the two was raising the blood price for his head significantly. In the center of the room was a contraption of two large chairs, back to back, sharing a single high backrest with a hole in its center. He looked at Lia, smiling sadly. He would miss her company. “You stand by your decision ?” She tossed her head, sending her long black hair flying. “Of course. The deal is much to good. Have any of your old apprentices ever backed out ?” “I never asked for their consent, to be honest .” She raised an eyebrow. “What made you change your mind this time ?” He smiled again, the warmth of his smile ripped away by lips revealing his full adamantine dental plate. “Maybe remorse. Maybe you are the first apprentice I actually like. Maybe you are to strong to be forced”. She smiled as well, then looked away. “Promise me that my mind will still exist .” “All memories, skills and knowledge - untouched. All character traits, morals and values - merged with mine, dominance lies with the stronger emotion. Magical ability - accumulated. The same is true for everything I am. I will not steal your body, Lia .” He gently took her face between both hands, between the three fingered one on the right and the spring steel driven contraption that replaced his left, and kissed her forehead. “I would not consider sacrificing the closest thing I ever had to a daughter just for another century or two. It breaks my heart to change even the little things that I will influence. I promise .” She nodded and wiped away a tear. She took her seat and watched her master use his spring-driven arm to lock her head into place against the hole in the headrest by tightly screwing down a crystal headdress. He touched her face in passing one last time. “Good bye, Lia Smith .” As he took his seat behind her, Master Mathemer de Troy regretted not finding another apprentice. Someone closer to his own character, but weaker. Someone he would miss less talking too. Preferably male, for the stronger sword arm, and the quick and painless ascend into the ranks of Masters. But he had never found another as talented and powerful as little Lia. And now the time was out. Life was not always quick an painless ... Mentally linking to the apparatus was easy. Linking to Lia proved a lot harder"
4,"I saw the button. It was simple, red, no words on it as I already knew what it did. I mean I built the button, I built what happens when you press the button, and I was given the choice of whether or not to push the button. Humanity was screwed, that much was apparent, Plagues and starvation across 3 planets and 6 space stations. That was why they approached me and now they have given me a choice, Save humanity and doom the universe, or annihilate humanity to save the universe. I knew what must be done. With my hand on the button I whispered 'May the universe finally know peace'. With that said the button was finally pressed. There were no warning lights, no countdown, just white and then nothing. 4 Quintillion people died when I pressed that button, killing every human in the solar system. I had become death, destroyer of worlds."
5,"“Goddamn, Ian, ” I sigh as I watch that brat risk his life. Again… This time he decides to jump into the lion’s pit at the local zoo. And as soon as he lands inside, he darts towards the *people-eating* animals with his shit-eating grin. I swear if it wasn’t for me being immortal myself, he would give me an aneurysm. After all, it isn’t my fault. I’m good at my job, so sue me. I’ve worked hard to give the guardian angels a good name but I never expected anything like this to happen. This all started about a week ago. Ian was skateboarding, not wearing any safety gear because his mom’s a miserable drunk and his dad’s only a few IQ points short from a brick. Anyway, I’ve saved him from little things here and there throughout his life but he was beyond screwed that time. Like on a dead-on collision with a semi screwed. Yet I managed to save him at the expense of a broken tooth. And in hindsight, my sanity. Shortly after, he became the talk of the town. Doctors were baffled, pastors called it a miracle, and everyone seemed to have their eyes on the “wonder child” . You see, surviving accidents like that create an ego the size of Texas, much too large for a fourteen-year-old moron. He got some crazy notion that he was immortal and started to do a whole bunch of daring stuff – all things I had to yet again save him from. And from that, he grew worse with time. I’ve not been able to take my eye off of him for a moment in fear that he will die in some horribly gruesome way. After all, he’s my money maker. Which leads us back here, watching him teeter on the brink of death as he tries to wrestle a pack of lions. I consider standing on the sidelines for this one. After all, he will only learn through experience. It’s like what they say: “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” But of course, he’s much more likely to die than become stronger. He lets out a nervous chuckle as the lions stir from their slumber, stalking towards him. When they bare their teeth, the fear in his eyes is unmistakable. I shrug my shoulders, flying into the pit to save his sorry ass for the umpteenth time. It doesn’t take much, anyway. Animals can sense guardian angels and usually get the memo to back off. If not, there are other ways to subdue them. To my relief, the lions comply and return to their side, ignoring Ian’s juvenile insults. Once he sees they won’t attack him like planned, he crawls out of the pit. And once he leaps over the railing, he no doubt makes his way to the next dangerous animal he can find. I push my fingertips into my temples, regretting my life choice more than ever before. This is going to be a long day."
6,"I lifted the box of cereal, tilted it down a bit, and sent a shower of Lucky Charms cascading into the bowl. Then I lifted the jug of milk over it and tilted until it glugged out on top of the cereal. I picked up the bowl, carried it to the sink, and threw it down the drain. Then I returned to my seat at the counter. I lifted the box of cereal, tilted it down a bit, and sent a shower of Lucky Charms cascading into the bowl. Then I lifted the jug of milk over it and tilted until it glugged out on top of the cereal. I picked up the bowl, carried it to the sink, and threw it down the drain. Then I returned to my seat at the counter. I lifted the almost-empty box of cereal, tilted it down a bit, and sent a shower of Lucky Charms cascading into the bowl. Then I lifted the jug of milk over it and tilted until it glugged out on top of the cereal. I picked up the bowl, carried it to the sink, and threw it down the drain. Then I returned to my seat at the counter. “Level 12 cooking reached !” a voice announced from every corner of my kitchen. “Great ,” I grumbled. I eyed the half-empty pallet of cereal boxes in my dining room next to the twenty-something gallons of milk I 'd bought. Outside, the sun had nearly reached its apex. Noon already? I 'd first tried to make eggs at 7:30 AM. “Only a few more hours of grinding till I can have my damn breakfast .” -- -- This story brought to you by the millions of iron daggers crafted in Skyrim while trying to level up my smithing skills."
7,"**Prelude: ** “Brujeria ,” they said, looking about the landscape as they said it. “The one you seek is Brujeria. “Travel past Three Rocks and you will find her hut. But speak to no one of your visit .” Agueda was a young, but she knew what it meant if her mother were to die. Mother had been sick for quite a while, and the Ayuhuasca was n't working. The Urarina people were dependent upon their male shamans to delve into the spirit world, and seek out that which is causing the balance to break between the life of her mother and the illness that had struck her. But they could not make her well again. Agueda was desperate. At the tender age of 8, even she knew that if her mother had died, she would be alone in the village, and left to fend for herself. Agueda walked the forest, along the Chambira river, and spied the Three Rocks at the bend of the river. She went straight from there and saw a makeshift hut, with a fire burning with some fish being prepared. Agueda did n't know she was hungry until she saw the fish being cooked. She came up to the fire and plucked a fish from the stone that sat beside the flame. Without even thinking, she starting biting into the soft white meat of the fish, and savored every bite. She took another bite, and another. Before she knew it, the fish had almost been completely devoured. “It tastes good, yes ?” A voice said behind her. She jumped at the sound of the voice, dropping the fish in fear that she had been caught. She at once understood the fish was n't hers, and that she had done wrong in stealing it. However, an old woman now held the remains of the fish, having caught it before it hit ground. Examining it, she offered it back to Agueda. “No use for me now. You take it, you finish it .” Agueda nodded her head, and finished off what was left of the fish 's meat near the tail. The old woman eyed her, with an eye both sympathetic and yet still analyzing. It looked as if she had seen more than her age had let on, and her hair was so grey that it almost was white when the sun rays came through some of the trees to illuminate it. The sinews of her arm looked like a withered tree branch, but in them she felt there was a strength that was beyond that of the strongest of men in her village. This was the Brujeria. She spoke up to the strange woman, shyly given what she had just done. “I 'm sorry elder. I was just so hungry ... .” “The spirits told me ,” the Brujeria said, interrupting. “And I was happy to oblige. It is a small thing for me to offer one so young, that has traveled so far from the village to seek one that should not be sought .” As Agueda looked into her eyes deeper, she saw that there was a faint glow that almost whited her pupils. Was the Brujeria in a trance? Was she seeing both her and the spirit world, speaking to both at the same time? Agueda knew at once that the old woman knew what she had come to her for. “Yes, I do .” Replied the Brujeria. The old woman sat down on a log beside the fire, and began eating the other fish that was on the stone. “Again, they told me. The Ayuhuasca does not work, they said. These are only plants that do not speak to the will of the the spirits that house them. Drink this .” Agueda looked to the fire that the Brujeria had pointed to and saw a makeshift pot with a brew boiling. It was Ayuhuasca, but it smelled different than the ones that the village shamans prepared. This boiled with a certain glow to it, and it smelled sweeter. Was this an attempt to steal her energy? Her mother had always warned her about the dangerous Brujos that wanted nothing more than the life force of the ones that drank before them. “I am not some fiendish Brujo as they say, child ,” said the old woman. “The old ones know better, but I have been here because I need to be. I have need to study this book given by a man, and every eye in the village has sought to peek into its pages. Yet it is not for them, lest they summon curses to their souls that no healer can repair. So I stay here, for their sake, not just my own .” Agueda looked at the book that the elder produced on her lap. The book was as tattered as the rags that she was wearing, but there was no mistaking that the air around this book brought a certain chill to her bones that the fire could hardly warm. Could this woman be the Warlock of Chiloe? Agueda once heard stories of the power of this"
8,"So this is where it had all led him. The sun rose beautifully over the cityscape, painting the clouds with its rays in pastel hues, colors changing as particles of light refracted and reflected, bouncing around the skies aimless and endless, purposeless, never to rest, and most of all unknowing of their own vain labors. Ray stepped over the guardrail and perched on the precipice of his 100-story lookout, pensive. Many things ran through his mind; his shitty job, his hateful parents, the loss of his wife, the only person he 'd ever truly loved. But mostly he wondered how his reaper could have abandoned him so. To most people, a reaper was a curse: a constant reminder that death was always there, waiting. An undeniable proof that no one lives forever, and everyone will die sooner than they think. The closer it was, the sooner you would die. Despite society 's countless incredible technological achievements, they could never figure out how to separate themselves from death personified. This never stopped the rich and powerful from trying; as their reapers got closer, no insane pitch from a fast-talking entrepreneur was too outlandish for the wealthy to throw their money at. They called them Death Profits: a play on words of both the money made from misfortune and the undeniable truth that their failures proved. The diamond guillotine, the snake oil supplements, the guided meditation and isolation, even the hyper-boosted trips to space; nothing could rid a person of their reaper. Which is why Ray loved his. Where most saw a terrifying ghoul, Ray saw a comforting promise. A guarantee that he would not have to exist forever. When his wife was killed in the car crash, Ray had seen in the rearview his own eyes, his own fear reflected as his wife 's reaper came barreling in from behind. In just a moment he realized it all; they were due a freak accident, a change of fate. And then, grotesquely, a smaller reaper, its ghostly feet beating a silent *pitter-patter*, arm outstretched as it struggled to keep up with its mother. His daughter in the back. She was being cooed at by her laughing mother, gurgling happily in her carseat, blissful in her unknowing. What could Ray do? *WHAT COULD HE DO? * A thousand thoughts crossed his mind. *Prevent it somehow. Change fate. Swerve off the road. Offer your life as collateral. Pray for their earthly salvation. Something, something! * She looked to him, one last time. In that final moment. Her eyes met his, laughing creases changing to worry in slow motion as she saw the unbridled terror in his eyes, he could see everything, he knew as her mouth begin to move in formation of the question **he knew**, it was too late, too late, and he would never forget. He could see it now in his mind in perfect detail, wind streaming in the half-open window, playing lazily with that lock of hair that she could never keep tied back. Her lovely chest beneath her white sweater expanding ever so slightly, unfettered by the seatbelt she hated so much to wear. The hazel-flecked green of her questioning eyes in the light, the pupils contracting in turn as the sun flowed over one before the other. Her soft lips just beginning to form his name, asking him to protect her, save them, keep her safe: his wife, the mother of his child, his only love and the only thing he ever loved, *save us Ray, save our baby* and yet he failed her, just as with everything else, he failed her too and her would never forgive himself. *Remember, Ray. Memorize it. Remember what you did. Never forget. * Just before the impact he could not find his reaper. He knew what was coming and he did not want to live, without them there would be nothing to live for and he knew he could not save them and he wanted to die. But his reaper was not there. It was not there and then the impact came, his world ending in a great explosive conglomeration of crashing glass and screeching metal and shrieking twisting screaming tearing and then blood, theirs and his mixed up slick and smelling of iron and heat in the smoldering car. She had gone through the windshield. There was a gash above his head pouring blood but remarkably his limbs were intact and he crawled out of the overturned car to find her, cutting his hands and knees on the crystal shards that lay in a carpet around the vehicle. His ears were ringing. As he failed to stand, he realized he could hear the baby crying weakly. He tried the door but it would n't budge. He surrendered his broken hands and pulled with all his might, the glass cutting into his fingers and bleeding down and around the handle. Nothing. He was raising his elbow to smash it into the glass, and then felt a ghastly chill. It was passing through him. Her reaper. Bony arms outstretched, wisps of ethereal smoke trailing behind as it moved to fulfill its grotesque"
9,"At the Grand Canyon, there are many tourists trying to take pictures to make this memory last forever. However, I am near the edge of the steep canyon, amplifying my sight by ridding myself of hearing. It 's quite peaceful, looking at the true beauty of the canyon while no one is talking to you. Someone gets in front of me, and I decide to push in front of them. This is my view, and nobody will ruin it. I feel hands grab me, but slip off. I felt a sudden drop in my stomach as I flipped to see what was happening. I was falling, the people trying to help me at the edge. Looking to my right, I saw the person I had pushed flailing by my side. I made a mistake. A mistake that got both me, and my mother killed."
10,"They found him in a bin. He had 2 broken legs, his fur and skin had been burnt, he was blind in 1 eye, and he smelt like rotten flesh. They named him groucho. They took him to the nearest rescue centre, they cleaned him, they put his legs in casts, then helped him learn how to walk again. His fur grew back, his tail began to wag again, he learnt how to trust humans again. He sat In his crate and when humans came to visit, he sat and wagged his tail when they walked past him, his tail still wagged even when they picked another dog to take home. Weeks went by and his tail kept wagging every day, every vist, until eventually he found his new owner, who took him away to his forever home, and loved him the way a dog is meant to be loved. And he loved them back unconditionally."
11,"Fear. A delicious four letter word that humans loved to overuse, a banned drug that was made more delicious due to it 's illegality and rarity. Just like its cousin “fuck”, the true nature of the word was seldom found in this modern society anymore, though that was about to change. How many times had Jim heard a braggard utter the phrase “Last night, I fucked her, and it was amazing .” Jim knew that these men had never fucked anyone. They counted intercourse as fucking, and went on living never knowing the difference, safe in their own little world. Here was the similarity with fear. They lived with what they thought was true fear. Fear of losing their shitty jobs, fear of being embarrassed in front of their fake friends. They had never felt true fear, and only felt it in the moments before their brief lives were extinguished. Jim looked over the Cathy. He never thought of her in whatever name she was currently using to navigate modern society, simply thought of her as “My one .” As good as his memory was, he had learned a long time ago to let the inconsequential go, it made for a better organized mind. Cathy caught the look of days past flirting across Jim 's eyes. After centuries of being together, they had developed an ability to sense each others moods and thoughts, better than telepathy. Even with close to a thousand languages and dialects at their disposal, they had found it most effective to communicate with their form of telepathy. It was not telepathy as the humans defined it, it was more like understanding someone so deeply that every gesture, every little shift of their eyes, gave you the entirety of their thoughts. Though humans knew of this ability, they had mis-labelled it as “love” and stopped pursuing it as anything but a singular connection that lasted the briefest of periods. Right now, Cathy could tell that Jim ( Or as she thought of him “My one” ) was contemplating the nuances of human interaction. This usually led to a great fuck, some gourmet food and listening to some great shit. The fourth four letter word, fear, they had long abandoned its pursuit, after discovering their immortality was, well, immortal. “So are you ready to finally start our ascendance? ” Cathy asked Jim. She used a mixture of languages to communicate, their thousand language version of Spanglish. Even with their telepathy, there was never quite a substitute for a word, it was still the most powerful tool yet developed on earth. “Yes. Finally everything is in place, the race is ready. Still, it will not be easy, and this is just the first step on a long journey.” “Well, your brilliant friend once said “A journey of a thousand miles ...” Cathy replied, placing one hand on his arm, her warmth meant to comfort his soul. Jim smiled back, and taking her arm, led her into the studio set. The bright lights cause a momentary blindness, and as their eyes adjusted they saw their host getting worked over by the makeup department in his trademark floating leather chair surrounded by his trademark floating desk. Phil Lieberman was a world reknown scientist, a nobel prize winner in physics and currently focusing his brilliant mind on what he called “The future of humanity” . No one was quite sure what he was up to, but with credentials like his, people usually left you up to your own eccentricity. “We are going live in 3 ... 2.. 1 ...” “Welcome back to your favourite show, Past, Present and Future. Today, we have with us my comrades and well known science fellows, Jim and Cathy Kirkpatrick. I promise you, this is not a show you will want to miss. Now sit back, because soon, I will reveal to you the most astounding fact I have ever uncovered, and it will surely change the world.” Jim and Cathy smiled for the camera, glanced at each other, and waited for the commercial to end, the revelation of their immortality soon to end the notion of life for all humans."
12,"Ever since we were kids, me and the boys dreamed of our big break. We all played cops and robbers back in the day, right? Yeah, well, when we played it, we *really* played it. We drew straws to see who was cops and who was robbers. Short straws were cops. It was more fun to be the robbers, 'cause robbers are the ones who got a shot at making it big. At least they got a shot, you know? What do cops have? Nothing but problems. And every week we 'd pack into each other 's houses and listen to our programs on the radio set. When other kids were listening to Uncle Don, we tuned in to the Mystery House, and let me tell you, we did n't root for the good guys. Forget Charles Lindbergh, Torrio was the real hero on our block. This is some good bourbon, ai n't it? Got just the right kind of spice in it. Not too much, not too little; goes down just smooth enough. You ever try that shit back in the day? The bootleg stuff? Pops used to give me a sip every now and again before he got nabbed, God rest his soul. I do n't even know how we made it without him, you know? The early part of that decade was every bit as dirty as its name. Guess that 's what gave me my predilection for scheming. Well, we got a little older and a little smarter and we started to make plans. We were really going to do this! Like, really do it, and we were going to do it right. Getting in was the easy part, you know, but getting out was hard. We had to plan it from the inside out. But ... time goes by, things get put on hold, you get a real job ... “Real .” Like that word 's supposed to mean something when you grew up how we did? You ca n't just get a “real” job and get out of there. No, real only cuts it for so long. We 'd been talking for years before we finally sat down one day and said “Hey, if we 're gon na do this thing, we got ta do it now. We are n't getting any younger .” So me and Joey and Felix - Ha ha! Felix! Like the cat! - we bought some tommies from one of my dad 's old connections, a number runner from the south part. So we tell our wives - we were all married at the time, see - that we 're heading to work like normal, but we meet up at the park. We get into my car and I drive us down to the Fullerton State Bank. The thing goes off without a hitch, just like the programs. We bust in, tell everyone to drop to the tiles, and they put the money in the bag. Two hundred grand. We had two hundred grand in our hands, and we never had to fire a shot! Sometimes things just go right, you know? The cops must have been in the area already, 'cause they showed up real quick, a lot quicker than we thought they would. And who was the first uniform through that door? Butch Carwell, the bastard. Yeah, we knew him, so did the whole city. He was a mean son of a bitch with a bad attitude, known to light up like a candle if you push too hard, just like his dad. Well, that was just our luck. There was a swarm of police following him. We just set our weapons down and gave ourselves up. So Carwell puts us in the back of his car, handcuffs and all, and starts driving. We still had our eyes on that bag, though. He had it in the front seat next to him to take as evidence, but we could n't reach it all tied up. He waits for the other cars to set out back to the station and then he follows 'em. “What 's in the bag ?” he says. Joey 's kind of a smartass and responds “What 's in the bag? Money 's in the bag, you dolt! What do you think ?” “Funny, funny ,” he says. He says “How much you got in there ?” Felix says “Two hundred thousand ,” and Butch does n't say a word. He 's a cop! He 's probably never seen that much money in his life. I think the nostalgia hit him right then, see. We always wanted to be the robbers, cause they were the ones who had a shot. We see the cruisers ahead drive straight and Butch takes a left. Two more blocks and he takes another. We drive for a few minutes and get to the empty lot out front of Merl 's Hardware - it 's closed on Mondays - where his street car is parked. He pulls up beside it, opens the back doors and lets us"
13,"It was a long tiring day as usual. I leaned on my sofa throwing my bag on to the near by table. Slowly dozed off to sleep. My imaginations rushed in, I could literally feel my dream and it was of none other than an episode which caught my attention today. Me and one of my colleague were having lunch and a small boy standing outside the canteen was cleaning the window panes, he was hardly 10. Full greased head to foot, filthy clothes, torn shoes but with a cherry red lips and a droopy eyes filled with all innocence he could gather within it. It was raining and he was shivering after a while. He sat loopy near the window base facing me. I was having coffee then. As we started staring at each other I felt difficulty in drinking my coffee. It was nothing but me sitting comfortably inside the cafe warm and the boy now half drenched killed me within. I could n't read any thing from his face that he is not liking what he is going through. I called him and offered him a tea. Gladly he accepted it! I asked dont you feel cold, he told no I feel close to nature. I was so taken by the love and spirit he had within and his love for nature, the smallest things which I could n't realize which he made me feel was aw inspiring. I wish I had a mouse with me to take of the poverty in his life with a click, and fill his childhood with all the beautiful things he deserve. And soon i realized this was a beautiful dream, a dream that i would love it to come true. Daffodils"
14,"Carnival music seemed to dance in the background. A cacophony of color and knick knacks decorated the fairgrounds. It was just another day at the carnival. I sit at my stand reading another old junky sci-fi novel. “So how much to see it? ” Some pre-teen girl interrupted my book with her piercing voice. I sigh towards her and lean in. “Ten dollars, just like the sign says.” “And it works? ” “So I’m told. ” “You mean you’ve never looked? ” “Nope, ” I say, picking my book back up. “Well why not.” “Because some things in this life should be a mystery, ” I reply. “Well I want to see, ” she says. I tap on the money box and she places her ten dollars in. I watch her go in and wait for the audible reaction. After a couple of seconds I can hear an excited squeal. She runs out jumping up and down. “He’s so handsome! ” I can see her run off in excitement. I smirk. Another idiot, I think to myself. The carnival director walks up shortly after. “Time to start packing up, Isaac, ” he says. I nod and begin to break down my stand. My table is put away, and the money is locked up now. It’s that time again to put away the mirror. I stand in front of it like every other day. It’s just me, again. Same as yesterday, and the day before that, I am alone in the reflection. I smile at my reflection as I cover the mirror. I put the tent and everything in the back of my trailer with a skip in my step. You have to feel sorry for these suckers, I think. They’re destined for one person only. Who knows if they’ll ever find them? At least I know where to always find myself."
15,"I do n't consider myself much of a writer, and this is my first shot at a story on this sub, so if I do much wrong, I 'd love to know for future reference. Anyways ... *** I sat in the chair, tied down. I wondered where I would be sent. Previous offenders were sent to different places based on severity of crime. Serial killers or rapists might have been dropped in a North Korean concentration camp to be tortured and eventually die. Cases of severe fraud might have been sent to the Canadian wilderness before it was colonized to freeze or starve. The executioners though usually got a list of possible places to send the criminal based on their crime. They could pick whichever one they wanted. I know because I was one. I was booked for accepting bribes from mob to send their people to a place they could survive in. It was n't too hard because the machine did n't really keep records, and nobody really checked them since nobody cared. People could only get a general idea, within a few months if they wanted to by paying attention to the energy coming off the machine. If a location on the list was Hiroshima, I might have sent the mob boss to a few weeks after the bomb feel instead of right before as was intended. Regardless, that does n't matter. I 'm going somewhere where nobody will know me. Well, actually sometime when people wo n't know me. The new executioner was a rookie. I could tell. I mean, I could see the manual for the time machine from where I sat. He was taking a long time setting it up. Maybe he was deciding where to send me. The list he got was a few pages long. Would an executioner accepting bribes get sent to a horrid place like Russia under Stalin? Or maybe a less harsh place like an uninhabited island? I was curious. Personally I never dealt with people accepting bribes when I worked. The rookie looked up. I guess he finished with the machine 's console. Took him long enough. Damn amateurs. Wait a second ... Something was odd. I could see the status light from here. He was sending me to the future? I only did that once, by sending a mob boss a few centuries into the future. People would n't do that, too risky. The person might end up in a relatively safe place, or a really inhospitable one. No way to tell. Nobody could predict the future. I hoped for the former. Rookie mistakes, eh? The energy crackled. I was blinded. I opened my eyes. I saw ruins. They had a light dusting of snow. It was noon. The sun was low. Seasonal winter. Not nuclear winter. I looked at my watch. It had a Geiger counter. People wanted to cram everything into one device. I read in history how it started with cramming a camera, mini-computer, and a phone all in one. I do n't know when a normal person would use a Geiger counter though. Radiation was only a little above normal. Nuke Facts said that the level was like if I ate a few bunches of bananas every day. Kinda random, but it 's still better and more interesting than Cat Facts. That shit took forever to get rid of ... So I guess I was in the aftermath of a nuclear war with the clothes on my back and a fancy watch. It was safe to stand around. But I suppose I needed more than a lack of radiation to survive. I decided to head south, possibly to less snowy places. Good thing this watch had a compass. Something actually reasonable. Let 's hope that it also has a cookbook too, I 'm getting hungry."
16,"In the morn on the twenty-eighth day in the month of october in the year 1840 marks the date first ever an expedition from the blighted continent found it 's way into an English harbour. The American ships, as expected, were backward, but not as much so as one might expect. While the ships they boarded were no greater than those from the turn of the seventeenth century, they were marvelous in their craftsmanship: Long bows carved with ornate woodcraft ( their gods perhaps ), canon of unknown quality, large billowing sails, clean and professional rigging and the men aboard -- truly these men had sailed and had been sailing for a time. They were as the queen 's own. It gnawed upon me that when last sighted centuries earlier, many if not all the continent 's people 's were confined to freshwater craft; merely pilots of canoes and small rafts -- Primitives. Indeed, in time, they had come to much the same conclusions that naval engineers past had come, no doubt guided by the smugglers ... or perhaps it was the many burnt hulls of the galleons left upon their shores by the Spanish or, and more unsettling, perhaps it was a hastily deconstructed remnant of our own navy that underlay the proud woodwork and bid them their voyage here. Spying them with a scope from the pier I spied the visage of one man, A stern corsair upon the prow. He was stone faced and dark haired bearing no weapon with one foot on the bow and the other dangling over the edge, a lit stick of a kind in his mouth. He seemed stoical and unconcerned -- no doubt this was not the first port he had seen on his voyage in. Perhaps they had been to France and found no welcome? At any rate, as I scanned the deck I saw more than one other, and perhaps to their nautical detriment more than one woman aboard as well -- Though that perhaps spoke of other intentions. The admiralty has long dreaded this moment. It was, of course, inevitable. They would be curious as to why the world 's great colonial powers had stopped at their door, why ships long circled and barricaded their fledgling attempts at transport across the sea -- and more important why the lord 's anointed kings and our fair Queen held a line across an ocean for so long and then stopped. I felt ardour to call out a warning. I wished dearly to tell them that the few of ours who made it back from their sojourn died so miserably from having interacted with them. I would explain to them and tell them of the upheaval Europe and Asia faced, the death toll they brought upon us, “la plaga neuvo .” I would plead with them to leave. I would have if only I could but how does one recount this to them in their unknown tongue? How, in their language, can i say that they, without a single shot, had brought the once great majesty of our empire to it 's knees by that which is unaffective of them? How? We were left with but one way: The only way. Our answer could only be delivered at the end of a gun. As the ship broached towards land I made a signal to the man at my right and he bid the gunners up upon the ramparts to take aim and fire above the prow. At my order they fired, but the response was as suspected. They did not go back. I saw them, faces alive. It was not fear amongst them though, but jubilation. The men and women broke out into shouts and waved their hands in the air ... and here I noticed the small ones racing up to their sides. There was no doubt in my mind, the cannon were inactive. We were the first Europeans to see them, and conversely, they to see us ( and I ask again what of France? ). We fired a second warning. This one seemed only to confuse them, as they did stop their jubilation, but did not away. I wrestled with the orders given. They could not be allowed to enter the harbour, but they were non-combatants, women, children, and lost sailors as eager to see our face as we were to see theirs -- but ignorant of the horror they inspired in us and unable to see our recoil. As it came within the boundary, and continuing even after a third shot fired we had no choice. The admiralty had made the order: The plague shall not again reach England. I ordered the full regiment to fire and not to stop until she was down. The ship and rendered it 's carved facade to splinters before it 's cannon could respond, or perhaps it did not matter. These “wiley corsairs” were no more then family men with children with no training or regiment to the skill. All were dead by the midday, drown or shot. I wonder though as to their origin and purpose. Why would they bring their families aboard? Did it not weigh upon them there might be danger? Thereupon I mired for the remaining"
17,"Scissors for hands? Hockey masks? Invading dreams? Stalking campers? Is this what I 'm competing against? Such juvenile psychopaths. Such weak jokes, come on Freddy, really? Making fun of a bulimic girl is just too low for me. I 'll stab abdomens with zeal, but to bring humour, heck, even my voice! , to my murders is the sign of an amateur. And Jason ... you should 've stuck to that camp, and I ca n't believe I 'm saying that. When you went to New York, that was just shameful. When you went to space, yes, space, I thought someone has slipped me mushrooms under my mask. “Painful” does n't even begin to describe that episode in your sad sad life. Man. I miss Pinhead."
18,"“I 'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, but we must go to some breaking news ,” said the news anchor, Mark Matthews. “Our producers are telling me that as a result of the announcement from Mark Zuckerberg, heavy rioting and unrest have broken out across the country. We 'll take you now to Laura Harris who is on the scene at one of the protests .” “Yes, that 's right Mark, it is absolutely crazy down here, just outside of the downtown area. People are in the streets lighting fires, looting, and engaging in violent protests against Mr. Zuckerberg 's decision to shut down Facebook .” “Laura, have you been able to speak to any of the rioters ?” “Yes, Mark, I just spoke to a woman named Janice Schultz. She 's completely upset that she 'll no longer be able to share her family pictures and daily activities with everyone online, and let her children know that she 's such a great mother .” “Thanks very much Laura ,” Mark said. “Now we 're going to speak with Dr. Phillip Anderson, a psychologist from the University of Michigan. Good evening, Doctor .” “Good evening, Mark .” “Can you tell us what would cause this kind of unrest by so many people as a result of the eventual shut down of Facebook ?” “Well it 's not that cut and dry. However, studies have shown that the majority of remaining Facebook users are narcissists who use the service as a means of getting themselves attention, feeding their egos, and manipulating others .” “Do these people find any consolation in the money that Mr. Zuckerberg is offering in exchange for the likes that they accumulate before the shutdown ?” “For the most part, they do not. Only those who accumulate a large number of likes, and therefore garner attention from more people, will be able to feed their narcissistic needs. Others will be jealous and likely try to start drama in order to draw attention to themselves instead of the more popular users .” “That 's quite fascinating, doctor. Thank you for the insight. Coming up after the commercial break, what have we learned from the ebola outbreak of 2014 ?”"
19,"I held the little black box in the palm of my hand. Pitch black, perfectly cubed and nothing special about it, but it continued to hold my gaze regardless as if there were some deep importance about it. My friend Valhalla appeared out of no where and sat next to me, also staring at the cube. “What do you have there, Heaven ?” he asked. I continued to gaze at the box, refusing to look at Valhalla for even a moment as though I would miss something if I did. “This ,” I said. “Is the secret to the universe .” I could tell Valhalla was perturbed by this sort of knowledge, as if there was some evil about the cube. Or perhaps he did n't think such an object could exist. But I made it exist, and so it sits in the palm of my hand. He reached out to the cube slowly. “How is that the secret to the universe ?” I moved my hand away. “Do n't touch, it 's extremely delicate. It just is, like me .” “Just is ?” It was clear he did n't understand anything about the dynamics of the cosmos. “Valhalla, when you look at me, what do you see ?” “My friend, a boy like me .” I nodded. “There 's something else too. The one similarity between this cube and me .” Valhalla gave a sideways glance. “You 're both ... absolute ?” “Precisely. Me and the cube are absolute. When I wipe the existence of the universe, it goes into this cube and expands it infinitely. I become a part of the cube, trapped inside of it. It is black on the outside, white on the inside. There is no way to destroy or remove this cube from existence. It can only shrink or grow .” “I see. So why are you staring at it ?” If it was n't obvious enough already. “The universe is fascinating. I ca n't see all of it at once, I ca n't see very far to begin with. The future is blank, past is filled but also empty. I make of it what I will, and I always find it fascinating, because even still I can not understand it .” “You ca n't understand the universe ?” “Can you ?” “I guess not .” “The cube understands, and so I find it fascinating to watch .” “Cool. Well, me and the others were going to play a game of hide and seek. You want to join ?” I clasped my hands and made the cube vanish. “Sure !” -011"
20,"On days when he woke early, the President liked to have coffee in the Oval Office. There was something about watching the sky grow lighter and lighter as you sat your pajama 'd behind in the most powerful chair in the free world, sipping Marine strength coffee, that you just could n't achieve anywhere else. He was therefore disagreeably surprised to find a man in an understated grey suit sitting in that selfsame chair sipping tea. The President turned around and went looking for his chief of staff. “Mitch? Mitch! Where in God 's name ... .” He was met by a rotund, smiling woman who handed him an envelope and sat him down, gently but firmly, before closing the Oval Office door. “Hello, dear” she said and took his coffee away. The President reached for it like a child reaches for a safety blanket, only to have his wrist slapped. “Envelope first. Once you 'd read the contents we 'll sort you out a nice cup of tea .” He opened the envelope. He read the contents. He backhanded the teacup clear across the room and in a flurry of bathrobe he slammed through the door of the oval office and stood, quivering with fury, letter in clenched fist, glaring at the man who was sitting behind his desk. “What in God 's name is the meaning of this ?” thundered the President. The man sipped his tea, put the cup down on its saucer and raised an eyebrow. “You know perfectly well what it is, you 've read it” said the man. The voice had a calmness to it, but also a faint edge that said, without really saying it at all 'listen, johnny yank, I 've taken tea on lawns older than your country so do n't come barking at me for exposition', and the President found himself feeling ignorant and doltish by comparison. He sat down. “Well, yes, I 've read it ... .” “No one was more surprised than me” agreed the man. He shrugged “But when duty calls, what can one do? Can I assume you 've decided on a smooth transfer of executive power ?” The President flapped. “But ... but how can you.. ?” The man took a pair of spectacles from his jacket pocket and put them on. Then he looked over them at the President and he tutted. “How could we not? Honestly, my dear chap, today was completely inevitable. Look at yourself. Sitting there in your night attire, dribbling on the carpet and not for one sorry moment taking any responsibility. I 'm not normally one to critique others, but really. This is too much .” “But ...” “None of that !” snapped the man “We shall have none of that at all. You may not have signed the orders that brought us here, you may not have voted for the policies that made this inevitable, but you did n't oppose them effectively enough. Ca n't you see it ?” “See what ?” The man sighed. “It 's all true, is n't it? Faced with a reasonably well educated English accent, you really ca n't help yourselves. Very well, since you appear helpless and hopeless, one last explanation. “When you started kidnapping people and calling it “special rendition”, when you started surveilling your civilian population, when you armed your police with military weapons, when you restricted the freedoms guaranteed by the blood of your founding fathers, when you resorted to 'enhanced'interrogation techniques, when the news broke about Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib, what did you think was happening ?” “We were safeguarding the freedoms that this country loves !” barked the President. The man in the suit leaned forward. “You were doing no such thing !” he snapped, and the President flinched as if struck. “In point of fact ,” the man continued “these abuses, and others - do n't think your human rights record at home has n't made a significant contribution to this situation - have all taken you in a regrettable direction. One which has resulted in your country being handed over to a people more in keeping with that direction. It is my sad duty to inform you, sir, that you have become the villain. People feel Vladimir Putin is a more trustworthy figure. You are the Bad Guys, and as such the laws of international narrative demand that your organisation be run by an Englishman .” “This is insane” “Do n't blame me ,” said the man, picking his tea back up “it was your movie industry that sold the idea so very effectively. Now be a good chap and get off the carpet. You speak to the nation in an hour, and hand over control to your Eton educated overlords in an hour and a quarter."
21,"My phone had died at work again. This would, to anyone else, be a problem. Not to me, however. This had to be done carefully, with almost surgical precision. I placed my finger a few millimeters away from the charger port, and gently began to shoot electricity in my phone. Like I said, though: it needs to be done carefully. Wrong voltage level, and you fry your phone. Lose focus, and you fry *the entire office. * So I was steadily charging my phone, taking delight in how fast the battery level rose ( seriously, it *never* gets old ) when Jenny from internal audit rapped on my cube. I jump, my phone exploding in my hand. *” Christ Jesus! “* I exclaim. “Do n't sneak up on me like that !” She got a sheepish look on her face. “Sorry !” She said, hunching her shoulders and pulling her lips back in a grimace of embarrassment. God, she was cute. “It 's ...” I began, looking at the shattered piece of tech in my hand. “It 's not a big deal .” “Okay ... ?” She replied apprehensively. “What, uh, what happened to your phone ?” “Well ...” There was a brief pause that seemed to drag on for *hours, days, months* while I tried to think of an explanation for this. “I dropped it .” I said, with what I hoped was a finality that discouraged further inquiry. She seemed to think it over for a moment before finally continuing. “Right, well, there 's a happy hour tomorrow, as you know .” I nod, “Sure, sure. It 's at the old Rugby House, right ?” “Mm-hm. I was wondering if you wanted to make it a date .” She was never one to mince words, and I felt my heart begin to race with the conflicting emotions of nervousness and joy. Sparks began to dance at my fingertips and in my palms. “Sure !” I replied, right as thunder boomed outside and the power went out on a clear summer 's day in July. I opened my mouth to apologize before realizing that I could probably still save this. “Whew, damn, weird shit, huh ?” No reply. All of her hair stuck straight out from her head. I tried to suppress a laugh, and was increasingly conscious of the fact that my hair, hell, my whole body, is completely unaffected by electricity in any way. Generator power kicked in, and everyone seemed to be frozen in place, looking at one another, unsure of what to do. A phone rang, and the tension shattered like glass. Everyone began packing up their briefcases all at once as we were informed that the network was down. “So, coffee? I suggested nonchalantly. “S-sure .” She stammered, her hair finally coming to settle and the smell of ozone beginning to fade on a clear summer 's day in July."
22,"He was almost free. The thought of being held captive in that chair for much longer was eating at him. He squirmed when he heard footsteps approaching. No. Not now. He was almost free. The freedom beckoned to him every time he glanced at his watch or gazed at the door. But the footsteps signaled that he would n't make it. He was almost free. The footsteps could be heading to another cell, to another person eager to escape, but he doubted it. The footsteps were coming for him. He was almost free. Just a few more minutes and he would be free to make a break for it. His escape route was planned out well in advance. But the footsteps stopped behind him. He braced himself. He was almost out. But the hand fell on his shoulder. The voice, trying to sound sympathetic, merely said “yeah, we 're gon na need you to come in tomorrow .” He was almost free. And he muttered barely audible, “but it 's Saturday…”"

24,"Two years, 142 days. That 's how long i 've lived without her. She was my life, my other half, and every other cliche in the book combined; I ca n't think of anything better to describe how much she meant to me. When I found out she was cheating on me with her boss, I ca n't articulate into words how much I was hurt. I guess it would have been better if she put up a fight for me - told me she cared about me and all of that shit - even if I knew it was all a lie. Because then I would have closure, been able to say “we left each-other for this reason”. But I did n't get that. When I first found out, she grabbed her clothes and out daughter and left. No words. No goodbye. The other half - no - the entirety of my life suddenly and without warning left me. So for 2 1/2 years I have gotten through it. For 873 days, I have made myself trudge through the featureless, flat, futile experiment of life without her. Trudged is perhaps the wrong word. That implies the ability to walk, or even progress at all. Instead I fell flat on my face, barely keeping my head above the muck for long enough to take a gasp of air and refrain from asphyxiating myself in a mixture of alcohol and self-pity. There were days when I would wake up with no memory of what happened the night before; days when I would wake up 20 miles form my house and eve still days when I would wake up with a throng of people I had never met in my house. Whether it was my own version of postpartum depression or a product of excessive drinking I could never tell - it was most likely a mixture of both. Last night, however, changed al of this. I went through my daily routine, the one I had adapted to stop my already speedy descent into homelessness, and came home to finish out my day. I showered, ate, and got ready to go into the bed I used to share with the woman I loved. At some point during the night, after I had fallen asleep, I rolled over and felt something hard on the other side of the bed. A million different thoughts rushed through my head, foremost being that she had come back. Had she been too embarrassed to speak to me and instead climbed int my bed to continue things where they we so abruptly left? Had I drunkenly called her and asked her to come over and she obliged? As the millions of thoughts rushed through my head all in an instant, I began to caress her - something I so greatly missed. I still remembered every detail, every freckle and imperfection on her body. Her hair - she must have cut it short, this felt much different. It was much more course than I remember it being then too - maybe a product of the stress of her new life? But then my hands reached her body. Her skin, much rougher and less soft than I remembered. Her hips, much smaller? This made no sense. In my half-awake stupor, I turned don the light to investigate the changes that time had brought to the woman I still claimed to love. This woman was much different. Her skin cold and blue, her facial features marred by a slurry of makeup clearly messed up through tears. What had I done? What monster had I become? I could never do this to an innocent girl. This could n't have been me. Even if it was, me, it was her fault. Her fault for leaving me. I loved her, and I thought she loved me too. Look what she had done to me, what I had devolved into? I was a product of the mess she made in her wake. She would see that. I need to find her. I need to show her what she 's done to me. This is her fault. I love her. She ca n't live, without me."
25,"The lone predator, the silent assassin, I felt invincible last night, but what had started out as a routine hunting expedition turned out to be a much more dangerous affair. Creeping through the tall grass of the wilderness, I listened and watched. Spring had just begun, which meant there would be sweet, succulent younglings; but they would be faithfully guarded by their mothers or families. All around me, the sounds of life filled the moonless night. Were I inclined to show the weakness that is emotion, I would have purred gleefully at all of the prospects around me. That night I would feast like the king I was! Oh so many choices before me! Was I hungry for squirrel, pigeon, or maybe even bat? Maybe I would have one of each! The air tingled with activity. How to choose my first meal? And like a sign from the heavens, my eyes fastened upon it. High in a nearby birch tree sat a sparrow 's nest, and three helpless sparrow chicks. Wonderful, marvelous, nestlings, still too small to do anything but squawk—and the mother was nowhere to be seen! I had truly hit the jackpot. I crossed the vast field between myself and tree in total silence, my ears low and tail swishing rhythmically. My claws sank into the bark of the birch tree as I carefully scaled the trunk, making sure to stay on the far side from where the nest perched. The higher I climbed, the more my ears swiveled, listening closely for the telltale chirps of the mother swallow. As a mighty warrior, I knew I must never be caught unawares. Reaching the branch on which my prey sat, I checked my surroundings once again. Still I saw, heard, and smelled no sign of the mother. This was too good to be true! Being a feline, my balance was second to none as I crept along the branch. I kept low and close to my tightrope, inching forward. This was the pivotal moment when I would either emerge the victorious hunter, or be forced to abandon my mission. The nestlings loomed larger in my superior vision. So close was I now that I could smell their youth. It was a mouth-watering sensation. Finally I was close enough, and still the helpless meals had no idea I was upon them. My muscles tended as I scrunched down for the kill strike. Like a bolt of grey lightning, I launched through the air and onto the nest, my razor-sharp teeth catching a chick by the throat. My leap had knocked one of the other chicks from the nest to its doom—a two-for-one special! As I turned to carry my prize down the birch, the fur along my back raised in alarm. I could smell her very close to my. With a deafening cry, the mother sparrow came swooping down from the branches above me. *Looks like I 'm ordering to-go, * I quipped to myself, proud of my amazing wit. If I had been a bolt of lighting before, I was now just an indiscernible streak of grey now. My trusty claws propelled my across the branch and back down the trunk in mere seconds. Mother sparrow had missed her first strike, but was circling around to come at me again. I zoomed past the other nestling as I ran for the safety of my mansion, giving the second meal a forlorn glance. No seconds tonight, it seemed. The tall grass around me rustled as the sparrow made agonizingly close dives toward me. My safety was in sight! Only a couple more yards to go. Locked tight in my jaws, the nestling fought weakly to get free, life draining quickly from the pitiful bird. I was alive with energy, swerving through the field with ease. My legs pulsed with strength. I would be dining soon. Within feet of my home, the sparrow landed a lucky blow on my back. I rolled to the side, the bird 's momentum pushing me off course. Quickly I sprang to my feet, baby sparrow still in my possession. The mother was coming back in for another blow, and I did n't have anywhere to flee. Reluctantly, I spat the chick out and rolled onto my back just as the adult sparrow was on me. She and I fought claw to talon, rolling around the grass arena. The fiesta sparrow landed several good gashes on my stomach and sides, but ultimately my four deadly paws and a clean bite to the neck silenced my attacker. I flipped back onto my feet, refusing to show any sign that my injuries were painful. In the end, I had won not one, not two, but three meals that night. Proudly striding through the push-door to my mansion, I carried the mother sparrow now in my jaws. This would make a fine gift for my servant. She had always served me well, so she deserved the largest prize. I hopped onto her bed, and happily dropped"
26,"*What the ... .* “AIDAN! !! !” My boyfriend appears around the corner. “Did you do this ?” “Uh ... Nope. I most certainly did not ... Do what? And when did you go to 1600s England? And who is that guy ?” “I did n't. And I have no idea! If this is some sort of prank, Aidan ...” “It is n't, Nova, I swear! I do n't know what this is !” I had to laugh at the genuinely scared look on his face. Then, suddenly, he ran back over to the computer. “That man looks like ... David Tennant! And ... is that a TARDIS in the background! ?” I looked again. “Looks like it. Hmm ...” Suddenly ... *vworp vworp* something rectangular and blue started fading into view. “Hello !” said a man -the man from the photo! - stepped out of a blue box. “I 'm the Doctor! And who are you ?” “N-Nova ...” “Hello Nova !”"
27,"The hard part about polygamy is n't finding soul mates, that 's never been difficult for me, the hard part is finding soul mates with suitable schedules. If you 're going to play favorites with your wives you might as well just have a mistress, a kept woman on the side that you can buy with a cheap apartment and a nice cable package. Save your love and sacrifice for the “real” woman in your life and cast off the other once you 've burned through the pretty. A disgusting habit. If you 're truly going to do polygamy right you ca n't play favorites. It 's simply a matter of filtering out some of the loves of your life based on something superficial. Her work schedule. Who knows if I would be able to enjoy the life I currently lead if it were n't for my curious affliction. I 'd like to think that if push came to shove I 'd be able to make the time for my wives. I 'd like to believe that I 'd work cat naps into my routine and suffer gladly. But as it stands I do n't have to. I can see my boys off to school in the morning, work a full eight hours, greet them and their mother when they get back to the house and have a full dinner all before heading to Monica 's apartment to wake her for the graveyard shift. To some men I know that my lifestyle sounds like a nightmare but I love it. It keeps me busy. When you 're like me it 's important to fill the hours with the ones you love."
28,"“This time I 'm going to run .” I talk to my buddies in the mess hall, as they dig into their slop. Some of them are old friends, some are new faces, but they all know me. They know me through the stories, the story of the man who can cheat death. I 've done it quite a lot, developed a name. Everyone asks me how, I tell them that magicians never reveal their secrets. To be honest, my knowledge of my power is nowhere near informed. But a new guy was just the first to ask me why. I told him it was simple, that I did n't want to die, and I had the means of not having to. But he probed further, asked me if it ever got “boring”, living forever. I thought it over in my mind, it was twice now that I had gotten myself sentenced to death and trying to stick through it, but never being brave enough to stay dead. I lie and tell him that life is never boring, it 's fantastic and interesting. He asked if I would share my secret with him, of course I declined. He smiles at me, which is also new. Most do n't smile when someone in prison has a get out of jail free card, especially if it 's cheating death. I 've been in this specific prison about seven times, and as the only “regular” to death row, most stay away from me. Except for the guards. They have theories about my power, and if I do n't directly tell them if they 're wrong about me, they like to get a bit rough. I take a moment to dig into my glop, it is usually swallowable, but for the moment my throat feels tight. My new “friend” smiles wider, I try to speak, and realize I ca n't. He stares me down and says “I think I know a way to take away your power .” There 's something much more sinister about his disposition now, instead of seeming calm, and a tad naive, he looks condescending, and very, very angry. My throat gets tighter, much tighter. He puts his face in close and breath on me, and I 'm unable to stop him, my arms stuck by my sides. His breath is terrible, it smells like rotten flesh. He puts his left, tattooed hand around my my neck, until a guard sees. This guard walks over, and tries to break it up, and it seems like my lunch-mate does n't even notice his prying or yelling. Only after another guard comes over to break his grasp does he release, and I spit and gasp, terrified. The first guard sends my attacker away, while the second looks at me with disdain, the first amount of trouble related to me in this prison has occurred. I think it 's time for me to get myself into solitary confinement. I ca n't walk away from death anymore, I need to put some effort into getting the hell away this time."
29,"Cowboy Bill broke the silence. “Are you buying that or what ?” “Will you shut yer mouth? Let the boy make his own decision .” said Rough Middleton. “That much chips, I 'd take my sweet ass time also .” remarked Eddie. Everyone stared at Jason intently. “Take yer time, kid. Ai n't no rush .” Jason 's face was deep in thought. He glanced at Slick Rick, then to the chips in the middle, back to Slick Rick, then at the chips again. It was dead quiet while they awaited Jason 's decision, save for Rough Middleston 's audible munching on his potato chips, and the tapping of Cowboy Bill 's impatient finger on the table. Finally, Jason broke the silence. “I 'm all in .” Immediately, Slick Rick threw his two cards into the center of the table with a despicable face."
30,"I 'm not especially smart. Maybe that 's why everyone seems to hate me. My job, of course, was one that required someone especially smart. Someone like Winston Churchill 's third nephew or Abraham Lincoln 's half ancestor. But they chose me. Was n't my fault, being chosen. I mean, shit, I did n't even apply for the job. I applied for almost 20 jobs over the summer and the one that chooses me was the one job in the whole God-damned universe that I did n't even want. I got a call back from Safeway as well, but they were just trying to give me advice on what to say. So many people trying to give me advice on what to say. I suppose being chosen to be the voice of the entire species puts a certain target on your back, one that means, *Hey, come manipulate me or we all fuckin'die! * But they chose me, the aliens did. They chose *me* to plead the case of Humanity 's existence, not Einstein 's lesser known son. *Me. * I walked passed one of the countless shops playing my speech on the TV. It was a McDonalds, for crying out loud. Were they even aloud to have TV 's in their windows? I supposed it did n't matter, since we would all be dead soon anyway, but shit. As always, they cropped it out to show only the bad part. The subtitles spelled out the words so even the deaf could see my fuck up. “If you decide to exterminate us, make damn sure you do it right the first time, or we 'll come after you .” The picture switched to a news anchor drinking straight out of a bottle of vodka. “He 'd *killed* us all !” The subtitles said. How technology has achieved emotions and punctuation in subtitles was beyond me. “Asshole !” An old man threw a McChicken wrapper at my head as he passed. I headed in. Maybe they were hiring."
31,"“Malvina ?” “Yes, love ?” Answers the woman. “Do you love me ?” “With all my heart, Dieter. With every ounce of it I love you. What makes you ask ?” She says. Dieter shrugs gently, shifting in her arms. “I was just thinking. It 's been nearly four years since I came here and still ... Malvina, what am I ?” The queen tightens the embrace on her lover, tucking her chin on Dieter 's shoulder. A slight frown, one tinged with melancholy crosses her face. “You are a good man, and a loving one. One who I have never deserved. Your love is the greatest thing in my life. You are kind, selfless, honest and strong. That is what you are .” Queen Malvina answers. A look of rueful sadness crosses his face as he speaks. “What I mean ,” he says softly as he kisses her fingertips, sending fluttering waves through her. “is what am I here? Mordnacht says that I am a slave. Am I ?” Queen Malvina 's stomach drops as he treads upon the exact question she feared. “Mordnacht says a great deal of things. I would n't worry about what she has to say. That creature 's mind is half addled by time and the other half is full of schemes and plans. She wraps truth in lies and lies in facts. Her promises are worth their weight in gold, that is to say, nothing. Whatever she says, you must take with a grain of salt. You understand, Dieter ?” Dieter frowns at what his love says. Eyes hurt at her obvious dodging of his question. “Of course, but that does n't change what she said and which you did n't answer. Malvina, am I your slave ?” He presses. Queen Malvina 's embrace tightens slightly as pain crosses her face. “You are what you believe you are. If you choose to think of yourself in a particular way, there is nothing I can do to say otherwise. Just remember, you are what you choose to be .” He laughs softly, running a callused thumb across the palm of Malvina 's hand. “It 's almost amusing, I am the youngest person on this island, younger than even the little girl who looks no more than five years old. She is at least eighty years older than me. I 'm a child compared to every one here, and they treat me like it. Mordnacht says I 'm a slave, Sir Lawrence says I am noble man. Your subjects say I am beacon of hope and you say I am your lover. I am the only one who does n't know what I am. Am I a free man ?” Queen Malvina says nothing as the fireplace crackles, the sound of the spitting pinewood filling the empty quiet. Pain flashes across Dieter 's eyes, his gray pupils wetting with tears. “That 's what I thought .” He manages to finally say. “Malvina, all my life I have not been my own person. For years I did as my father ordered. I hid behind the notion that I was not a free man, that every death or act of violence inflicted by my hand was because I was just following orders. When I finally manage to break free of his influence, I was washed onto these shores. Even if you think you understand, I 'm not sure you can truly understand. Do you know how painful it is, loving the same person who holds you captive ?” “I 'm sorry, Dieter ...” Malvina whispers. A gentle smiles crosses his lips, causing him to lean over to kiss her on the lips. “We 're broken birds, Malvina. We were both born into lives of pain; you with your powers and me with my father. And we are both enslaved. Me by you and you by your own self-blame and doubt. The only way for me to be free is for you to be as well. Malvina, I 'm not demanding it from you, and years ago I promised not to asked, but ... will I ever gain my freedom ?” He ends his question in a whisper. Queen Malvina casts her eyes towards the fire, watching the flickering flames dance about the fireplace. “I know you and Sir Lawrence think I can change, but I ca n't. I am only sorry you were caught up in all this. If you had never come here ... I could have spared you all this pain. You could have found some other woman, someone who would have treated you better than I have. maybe it would have been better that way. Before you came, ever day was like all the others. For decades each day was the same, the same dull pain aching inside of me. I was more dead inside than my subjects and that 's how it"
32,"“Ummm ... hi .” Said the girl in the blue dress. There she was, framed in the doorway like it was a portal to another world. She was taller than Sam was by about a head, with eyes that matched the sea at dusk and hair the color of the dunes. A gust of wind ruffled her periwinkle dress, blowing a lock of her hair astray. She tucked it away nervously, avoiding his gaze. But Sam had already seen all that he needed to. He had seen it all before, a hundred times over a dozen trips to their little cove. But this time, out of all the times before, he was awake. *The girl in blue* ... He mouthed silently. Her blush deepened, and his own darkened to match once he realized she was watching him closely enough to understand. To his surprise, she smiled. “Sam, are you listening ?” His father said, providing a welcome distraction from his thoughts. “This is Meredith, she 's going to be staying with us for a bit while we 're in town. Now, I know she 's very pretty, but she 's the mayor 's daughter - so try to contain yourself .” “Dad !” Sam said, feeling his cheek burn even brighter. Luckily, at that moment the girl extended her hand. “Hi. I 'm ... Meredith. Nice to meet you .” She smiled just a bit wider. Sam reached out and took her hand. “Hi Meredith. I 'm Sam. And ... I know this is a little bit cheesy, but I think I have seen you in my drea-” Meredith woke up. She rolled over, silencing her second alarm with an almost-casual swat. 10:30. She was going to be late. Panic flooded her system, and before she consciously knew it her feet had hit the wooden floor of her room. She dressed, brushed her hair, and in a flash she was out the door. Today, of all days, she had no time to waste. Three streets down, across a little wooden bridge over a stream, and she was there. A cabin, one of dozens. But this one was special. The door opened, and there he was. Framed in the doorway like it was a portal to another world. Short, but endearing. His face was kind. It was exactly as she remembered it. But this time, out of all the times before, she was awake. “Ummm ... hi .” She stammered. She hoped that he did n't notice her blush."
33,"“What? Lunch? ” I ask as I pick at my salad. I look around for the waiter to complain that he forgot my request for no tomatoes but can’t find him. “I’m sorry kid.” Death says as he chews his chicken parmesan hero. I look up in confusion and see his eyes looking straight back at me. “What’s going on Death? ” I ask putting my food down. He looks down at his plate in shame. “I’m really sorry kid.” He repeats. I don’t understand how this could happen? “Why? ” I ask as my voice cracks. We’ve been friends forever and have been together through the good and the bad. He stays silent and takes a deep breath. “You told me that I was going to be successful and that this was my time. How long have you known? ” I ask through tears. He begins to talk but I interrupt, “How long have you known? !” I repeat raising my voice. “How old are you? ” He asks. I leave him with the tab and go back to my apartment. After a tub of ice cream and throwing away all my awards and trophies, I try to take a nap to no avail. I look at a letter on my living room table congratulating me on my promotion. I rip it to shreds and throw it at the television. My cell phone begins to jingle; it’s Death. Even though I feel bad for my reaction at the restaurant, I can’t speak to him yet. I look at my cell phone and contemplate what I should do. I scroll through my contact list and see Zac Efron. I won his phone number and address after beating Death in a game of call of duty. I never called it because I was a coward and didn’t know what I would even say. I press enter and wait for an answer. “Hello? ” a male voice says curiously. “Hi, Is this Zac Efron? ” I ask wondering if Death fooled me. “Yea, Who is this? ” He replied in a casual tone. I paused and my mind raced to put together a response. “Tomorrow 3 pm.” I say lowering my voice. “What? ” Zac asks. I start to apologize but he interrupts. “Look how young I am.” He says. “I am too.” I say feeling sorry for myself. Tears begin to run down my face and I hear: “Thanks for the warning. Look, I’m going to call up Vanessa and hit Vegas. Can you please make sure she gets home okay? ” “Sure dude. See you tomorrow. Have fun” I say. After a pause on the phone, he replies, “Okay, thanks I will. See you tomorrow.” We say goodbye and hang up. I realize that I should have some fun rather than moping the rest of my last day so I prepare my final outfit that I’ll wear tomorrow and then leave my apartment. I go to Death’s apartment even though I still don’t know what to say. He answers the door quickly with a surprised look on his face. He doesn’t say anything though and gestures for me to come in. I see that he ordered a pizza and grab a slice before sitting down on his couch. “Fast and Furious or the Avengers? ” Death asks me holding up dvds. “Avengers” I answer getting up to grab some popcorn. He laughs and gets more snacks too. I sleep my last night at Death’s apartment and get up early to go to work. I would go see my new office, go to lunch, and die. My office has a great view, two computer screens, and even a voice activated thermostat. After playing with it for an hour and eating all the M & M’s on my desk, I call up Death and we take an early lunch. We eat at the five star restaurant we always wondered about and reminisce. We talk about the old times and how we had several “bring your friend to work” days. Death and I had messed around all day in my cubicle. One of those days, about five birds flew right into my boss’s window and he came out in a stupor. Death looked right at him and said, “It’s like I’m the bringer of Death or something.” We laugh at the restaurant table thinking about all the great times. I remember the time we went to Six Flags and Death got sick after riding one roller coaster. “You shouldn’t have dared me to drink that whole milkshake right before! ” Death laughs. After we pay, we walk to the old beach. It is heavily polluted but it is a secluded spot so I figure this will be a good place to"
34,"He 's been my best friend since I was a child. I 've always felt different from the other kids. Growing up in a rich neighborhood, I never had what the other kids had; Ash got his first Pokemon when he was 5; Gary, when he was only 3. Because human-Pokemon interactions were highly encouraged, they would often bring their Pokemon to school and bully me with “Water Gun” and “Ember”. After one particularly bad day of bullying, I ran deep into the feared Turnback Cave and wept for hours. Why did they have to bully me? Just because my parents could n't afford the Pokeballs needed to catch Pokemon should n't mean that I could n't afford the barest respect from my peers. As my tears dried and the sobs turned to sniffles, I began to try to find my way out, only to discover that I was more lost than Diagla 's Adamant Orb. I heard crying and whimpers ahead, and, after approaching the sound, found several Geodudes and Onix intimidating a chubby and helpless Gible. Using my body, I protected Gible from the relentless punches and rocks thrown. It was the first time I was able to connect with another being. We both suffered at the hands of the many. As time went by, Gible and I became close friends. Though he maintained his stubby stature, his loyalty grew, and we gained each other 's respect. The first time I brought Gible to school was about a year after I met him. I could n't bear to leave him locked in my room alone for such long periods of time. The recess bell rang, and I headed out to almost certain harassment again. This time, though, I prepared myself for even greater harassment, as I would need to protect Gible at the same time. I could only strain my ears in hope that the bell would ring and call us back into the ( relative ) safety of the classroom. Rocks pelted my back, water stung my eyes, and fire charred my eyebrows. Suddenly, however, Gible began to glow, evolving into a powerful Gabite! No longer stubby and helpless, Gabite sported wicked sharp claws and a lean, muscular body covered in a hard shell. It seemed as though Gible had had enough of being a weakling and decided to fight back and to stand up. That day, my Pokemon and I grew closer together. It would not be the last time that Gible, now Gabite, would protect me from outside assault. As he grew rapidly in size and strength, the small bed I had formed for him was no longer able to house his powerful frame, and he soon moved under my bed. Though Pokemon to others may seems like monsters, my Gible was never monstrous. He was and still is the loyal and friendly Pokemon that I met so many years ago. This is my first prompt, and I 'm half asleep right now, but all criticisms ( especially content based ones, this is harder than i thought ) are welcome!"
35,"Imagine a life controlled by a man in the sky who decides what happens to you every single moment of every single day according to his whim and fancy. Your existence is nothing but a play toy to him. You serve no purpose other than to entertain his audience. I 'm not saying that such a life is necessarily bad, because more likely than not, you end up living happily ever after - because who does n't love a perfect fairy tale ending? It 's those stories that have n't been completed, however, that are the true nightmares. Imagine your life put on hold. Time goes by, yet nothing happens. At first, you have hope. Hope that your life too will have a happy ending just like everyone else. Hope is both mankind 's greatest strength and weakness. Hope keeps us pushing forward when everything seems to be against us. Yet, that same hope makes us blind to the true world around us. We chase after things that were never meant to be. As days go by, hope gets replaced by anxiety. You spend your days thinking - worrying - obsessing about what might happen next. Doubt begins to creep in. Will you have a happy ending? Will you have an ending at all? Days become weeks. Weeks become months. Months become years. Yet here you are, stuck in the same spot in your life. You now feel the pain of rejection. Do you not deserve to live happily ever after? Did the man in the sky decide you were not worth the effort? Is your existence really that meaningless that he does not even bother to finish your -"
36,"They all knew his name, but no one dared speak it. He lurked beneath every step, between every landing. At the mere mention of his name, they were tormented with nightmarish visions of sweat-soaked faces and the pounding of their feeble hearts. The thought of his soulless eyes plagued their everyday lives, forever haunting their minds with sickening memories: gasping for their last breaths, collapsing and clawing at the floor, anything to escape *him*. Their fear was so great that they would lock themselves into metal prisons of awkwardness known as *elevators* simply to elude his presence. There they would stand in painful silence, waiting uneasily for the torment to end with the sweet release of the *ding*. Yet nothing could surpass the anguish of the Stairway. They would even resort to the human meat grinders known as *escalators* over the terror of his homestead. Yet some succumbed to his sinister coaxing. Some honored him with horrifying rituals of masochism to be rewarded with toned muscles and lean bodies … but at what cost? Only people such as these were found lurking in the desolate wastelands of the Stairway as the others averted their eyes with dread and disgust. He claims more souls with every passing day. And he will never rest. Not until every person on Earth has suffered the agony of the Stairway. His name? *Exercise*."
37,"Jackson had been a soldier in the 15 years war of China back in 2225, and he had seen atrocities. Atrocities was a good word for his experiences there, he felt. Short, and simple. He liked that, because it made a hellish nightmare easy to grasp in his mind. He had seen atrocities. When he returned to the Fractured States after the American, and West European victory over China, job opportunities were scarce, to put it in simple terms. The war had damaged Jackson in a fundamental way. Physically, he was fine. He had come back unharmed, save a few small scars he 'd picked up sharpening his Bowie knife. His mind though, had been fractured worse than the United States had been when the Chinese launched the unexpected nuclear missiles that began the 15 Years War of China. When a man in a fine suit came, and offered him a job as a guard in a mining camp on a far off planet he could hardly refuse. Not because the pay was good, it was, but because life on Earth was frightening. He 'd seen what men could do to each other, and that fear would never leave, no matter where he went on Earth. The fine suited man offered him a job on that lush green planet that sat almost cozily on the boarder of the Milky Way. The life provided there offered him a feeling of security, and safety he had not felt in months since returning home. On this planet he could have a sense of security knowing that the total population was roughly 500 humans, mining the planet 's metal resources, and security staff guarding the miners from the planet 's local inhabitants. With a population like that there was n't a chance of mass war extinction. Jackson had never left the Earth 's lovely, life giving atmosphere before so the experience of leaving on a rocket was thrilling for him, and even, oddly enough, made him relax for the duration of the ride to his new home for the next decade. Leaving the planet he was born on had been an experience that he did n't expect to be topped, at least not soon. What he found on his new home shattered his previous exhilaration. Jackson had been on his new planet one week. One week to learn the layout of the bases, mine locations, and being briefed on the local life forms. At the end of that first week, he was introduced to the specimen research facility located 35 miles from where he landed, and another 43 miles further away from the mining operations. That was where he encountered the *thing* that would bring him a new thrill. It sat in a cell with steel bars across the front that were thicker than Jackson 's torso was. It sat with its arms pulled behind its back cuffed at the wrists, what Jackson presumed would be its elbows, and finally a chain around its neck that wrapped the upper portion of its arms. It was shockingly human in its general body structure. Single head, a torso with two arms that looked almost cartoonishly muscular, as were the neck and chest of this creature. The arms were long like a gorilla 's and it had short, stocky legs. It did n't look like a runner. It stood ramrod straight as soon as Jackson entered the cell hall and saw him. The human symmetry was were the similarities ended though. While humans were anywhere from a pale white to a dark brown this thing was red, almost like a fruit with patterns that changed shades of red all over its body. “That there mother is our prized specimen ,” began Captain Cage, Jackson 's supervisor. Captain Cage continued “We have him chained like that because when we first brought him in he broke the original chains we had on him and damn near broke out his cell. He mangled one of our recruits that got too close to the cell bars while he was rampaging. After that little display we thickened his cell bars, and gave him extra chains, courtesy of upper management .” Jackson responded with a simple murmur. He was n't much for talk. “I call him Rattles ,” Captain Cage said, almost affectionately. “He likes to become active at night and rattle in his cell, and keep us all up at night .” Silence fell over the two men as they observed Rattles, and Rattles in turn observed them. Jackson had taken a disliking to Rattles within seconds of seeing it when he walked in, and after another moment of silent observation he realized why. “Rattles is intelligent, is n't he ?” Jackson marveled. “More than intelligent. He 's god damned cunning. After we upped his security he spent four days just laying in a corner ignoring his food. We thought he had expired in captivity, but when we sent guys in to collect the specimen, the moment he heard the lock click he jumped up, and flayed Anderson 's arm. Thankfully we had multiple locks on the cell door, so Anderson was the only casualty .” Captain Cage explained. after"
38,"The sound of the sea wakes me from my sleep. I open my eyes and am greeted by darkness. Bewildered, I grope around in a panic until I realise I’ve been dreaming. It’s the same dream every time- I’m walking on a sandy beach. The sun is beating down on me, and I’m pleasantly hot. I can taste the salt of the ocean air, feel the soft sand beneath my feet and hear the roar of the waves. I am surrounded by golden sand and endless stretches of sea. I look down and see my shadow next to me. I look down to discern its shape, and then I wake up. The few seconds between dreaming and being awake are bliss. Then the hard reality comes crashing down on me. I look out the window. There’s a moon tonight. The neighbourhood is lit up in a soft glow. It’s risky, but I have to take what I’ve got. Hurriedly, I pull on some jeans and a hoodie and venture out into the darkness. The cold chill of the air hits me and I begin to shiver. I walk briskly. At night, everything is silent. It’s too late for anyone except for creeps like me to be awake. All the houses look large and imposing. The trees cast long shadows in the street and shake when the wind rushes through them. I start to jog to warm up, and soon I’m sweating. I think back to my dream. Every time, I feel so close to finding out what my shadow is supposed to be. If only I could stay a few seconds longer, I would find out. And then… I’m so immersed in my thoughts that I fail to notice someone on the other side of the road. We both see each other at the same time, and eye each other warily. Fortunately the moon has passed behind the clouds. He looks around my age; another bored teenager traversing the streets at night. Only he’s not impaired like me. He looks up at the sky and slowly starts to walk towards a streetlight. The universal sign of peace. I see his shadow come into view. It’s a dog. I’m guessing a golden retriever. Under the lamplight, both the boy and the dog stare at me, alert. If I was a normal person, a ‘ good guy’, I’d come under the lamplight and show him I have a normal shadow too. But I don’t. I turn around and walk in the other direction, and hear him break into a run. He’s afraid of me. The only reason anyone avoids the light is if they’re ‘ bad'. Their character is reflected in their shadows. An evil man creates a monster. I shiver again, but this time it’s from loneliness. Why couldn’t I be like everyone else? Why couldn’t I have a shadow. The moon comes out from behind the clouds and the light hits me. I walk, but there is nothing beside me. Hopefully I won’t meet anyone again tonight. There are still a few hours left before sunrise."
39,"50 years is a long time, enough time to go crazy and return sane. I remember before it happened, the [ CDC joked that they would have a cure “within a week” ] ( http: //www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm ) when they had n't been able to cure HIV in 32 years, they had known about herpes for 2385 years and only had a treatment, and the flu remained a menace up until there were n't enough humans left to contract it. To the credit of the scientists, they all worked until the only thought they had was about their brain cravings. I had had a new “stem cell” treatment the year before, it helped recover some of the nerve damage i had gotten when i was young and had to have a surgery to correct a malformation. In those days, it seemed that the end to all disease and disfigurement were just around the corner, technology and biology hand in hand to save the human race. The funny thing is, my only guess to my resistance to the zombie infection and the zombies total lack of interest in me is probably due to the stem cell treatment somehow. The outbreak did n't take long, it started with a HIV like infection where only if you were bitten or zombie bodily fluids came in contact with someone, only then could you be infected. The virus became symbiotically linked to a bacterial group, then also a mold. With new methods of transmission, only the people on the ISS were safe from infection ... They got to starve to death and have a front row seat to the end of the world. By the time the infection made it here, there was no time for panic. The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water.. by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone. It 's spread was attributed to standing water in the water traps of sinks and toilets and their connection to the sewage system. time from infection to zombie was about 6 hours, and was mostly flu like. some people simply fell asleep never to wake with a human thought again. The thing about zombies that most zombie movies neglect is thermodynamics. Zombies do n't eat other zombies, and most animals can flee zombies or are immune. This means that a zombie must consume material to continue locomotion, and that energy must be expended to remain “alive”. Once the zombie 's guts had rotten past usability, a zombie would only be able to live for about 32 hours. Given that the zombie would run out of ATP fairly quickly, they would spend most of that time too stiff to move. This meant that anyone who was smart enough to remain out of sight, would be able to survive. The actual “zombie apocalypse” lasted about 3 years. Year two I went a bit crazy, I went through a mental breakdown where I assumed I myself must be a zombie and joined a horde. We chased some wildlife, and ate the remains of some survivors that starved to death. It was the sight of that rotting family that snapped me out of it, I slipped away and let the horde.. do their thing ... but that was 48 years ago, with eternal youth and a city of books and movies you can learn to do anything. So I learned to do pretty much everything. I was n't going to die anytime soon, I had a garden and traps set up within year 4. So it was easy to learn to make and do everything. One of the things i did was set up a “mesh network”, reprogramming WiFi routers to make a city-wide network that could allow me to monitor and automate things. Stealing some solar panels off of highway department signage and daisy-chaining them, I was able to muster enough power to keep the local radio station transmitting. I linked the computer up to my mesh network so I would n't have to set foot in there again. I set up heat sensitive cameras on every entrance into the city and tuned in random radios to my station, kinda like turning on the tv when your home alone, except with a whole city. For a whole year, I scavenged every solar panel i could find. From the bigger ones that the city put on their structures to going through offices for their pocket calculators. I scavenged other things too, Canned food, WiFi Routers, Medication, security cameras, loose wiring, movies, books, video games, Hard drives, portable PCs, IDs, Photos, phones, anything that may have held the voices and images of other people. I would also gather electric cars, with solar, i could charge them and use them. The wrecked and damaged ones could be used for parts, the ones in good condition I would store indoors to use as ether. A Camry Hybrid power cell and an alternator attached to a windmill or a solar cell could keep a couple WiFi routers chugging along for a few days. A single hybrid contains 34 of them. The mesh network also has a feature where any new nodes and unrecognized WiFi scans are reported to me."
40,"I could n't believe what was happening, i was supposed to open a bakery, not be a soldier. Here i was, covered in the blood of other men, my friends and brothers scattered in pieces all around me. “I WAS SUPPOSED TO BAKE BREAD !” I screamed, rising from the trenches, my boots sloshing with blood and filth. “I WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE PEOPLE SMILE !” I raged, marching towards the enemy, my armor once shining and silver was now gleaming and red. The enemy gazed in fear at me, they had met others from my city, the barber, the teacher, even the doctor, and now they faced the Baker of seville. My hands ached for a weapon, the bezerker chems coursing through my blood as my armor injected me with shot after shot of stims, the safety long overridden in my attempt to save my home. I lifted my rolling pin and hefted it to my shoulder, even with the stims it was heavy, weighing in over 200 pounds of chaostrium. I flexed my shoulders, rolling them to make sure my armor moved smoothly, the sharpened points and edges all free of debris before i started my charge. We were the bezerkers, outfitted in hinged armor, covered in points and sharp edges designed to shred our enemies, i was the last. My rage and my stims had brought me far, i stood proud in front of my city, even the butcher had fallen, but the baker, i still stood. Long ago chaostrium was discovered, it had incredible properties, it was lightweight, stronger than any other metal or alloy, and when you hit something with it, it multiplied the force. I was wearing custom armor, built entirely of chaostrium. I would avenge my family, my friends, my home. I would stride through the fires of this hell we called war, and i would punish the ones who called themselves warriors. Tears streamed down my face as i screamed “PET MY BREAD” and met my enemy in combat."

42,"I had n't got much of a look outside. We were remote, that was for sure. Snow and trees for eons. I grew up somewhere a bit more crowded. I figured they had too. A bunch of city kids in the sticks. I did n't join the Army for this. I joined to fight. The cow chow was not so bad. There was an egg in it. I wondered where it came from. A whole egg, just for me. Gosha left again. She was gone a lot. I was n't even sure if she slept here. I figured it had been over a day but I was n't sure. Sebastian was sitting on the floor, using the leg of the table as a back rest. The book looked pretty big. He seemed to be about halfway through. “You gon na give us a story ?” There was the faintest edge of darkness in the windows. I figured it got dark early here. It got dark early back home. He looked up. “Ce ?” “I do n't see anyone else, now that Hayworth left the stage. Come on. I 'm bored outta my mind .” I should have packed a book. All I had was a few letters from Bill and Ma and some of the girls from school. They were all old. I wonder if they sent my Ma a telegram. I really hope it was a letter though. Good thing Bill 's young. No way I want him mixed up in this. Sebastian waved the book. I sighed. Jesus. I know he was n't stupid. He waved it again then grinned. Oh Christ. Asshole thought he was funny. “Yeah, yeah. You 're a riot. Come on Chapman .” Sebastian cleared his throat loudly. Then he dramatically turned back to the first page. What a ham. “Când privesc mult timp un punct fix pe perete mi se întâmplă câteodată să nu mai ştiu nici cine sunt, nici unde mă aflu. Simt atunci lipsa identităţii mele de departe ca şi cum aş fi devenit ...” I just listened to him read. I had no idea what it was but it was relaxing. It reminded me of my Dad. When he was alright, which was n't often, he would sit at the doorway with the light behind him and read me and Bill some Dickens. He did n't do voices or anything like that. He would just read in this even tone. I did n't cry. I could feel something like it but I held it down. I could feel the draft against my fingers. After a while Sebastian trailed off. He was just looking at his lap, the book spread across his legs. I recognized the empty look. I knocked my fist on the floor. “Get to bed. I 'll be alright. Go on .” He rocked to his feet. It seemed to take an age for him to cross to the cot. He hand to brace himself on the frame. As he coughed his shoulders shook. It sounded dry. I closed my eyes. I did n't mind him so much. The Italians I knew from back home were alright and the ones in Rome were coy but not unkind. I got to see the Vatican. That was a hell of a thing. It was possibly the quietest place I ever been. The walls were tall and thick. Felt like you could ride out a bombardment there. Hell, felt like you could ride out the whole war there. I did n't tell anyone but for a minute I almost wanted to. I was still awake when Gosha returned. She smelled like the metallic cold. I must have done something because she caught me. The gloves kept her hands warm. The stiches did n't feel so tight. She even smiled at me. Was n't personal but it was nice anyway. “Sebastain read me a book .” I said. Gosha looked a him. He was curled up like a kid. She shook her head. “Is he going to die ?” She shrugged. The distance was back. She must have brought him here. Must have brought the both of us. I was going to go crazy like this. “Die ?” I pretend to go limp. Gosha shrugged again. She put a bag in the table. There was a sack of some sort of grain, a few eggs, a knob of butter. Gosha frowned at the food. Then she collected my bowl off the floor. The cow chow had gone crusty inside. She stacked Sebastian 's inside of it. I watched her sit at the table and bury her face in her arms. She did n't cry either. Where Gosha went she did n't let Sebastian tag along. He walked the length of the room. I was bored enough to put out my eyes. What I would"
43,"The lights on the Ferris Wheel went out just as I usherred the final rider down the platform. A short line was still waiting at the gate, time for the last ride of the night. I take two tickets, rip them in half and put them in my pocket. “I 've never been on this ride before” “Just lean against the wall, this one is the best .” “You said the boat was the best .” The young couple walked up the ramp. I take a ticket, rip it in half, put it in my pocket. “Are you closing? I still have four tickets !” “Yeah, last ride. We 'll be open until 6pm tomorrow .” The wirey brown haired boy walks up the ramp, not quite frowning. His parents stand at the gate arguing about who will get him on Halloween. He wo n't be using his tickets tomorrow. “You closing homie, just let me on this one .” “Sorry, bro. Got ta have a ticket .” “Man I know you closin', jus'let me an'my boys ride this time. No one will know. Yall won'even be here monday .” “No, move out of the way .” Two middle age women hand me tickets and push past the freeloaders. “I got two, sorry man .” I take the tickets, two teenage boys walk up the ramp leaving the third behind. He scowls at me and pulls out his phone. “Homie, they closin'. Come get us. Yeah I got you. The 7-11 ...” I close the gate and walk up the ramp. All riders are evenly spaced around the outside of the gravatron, each leaning against a pad along the wall. I glance around at each of them, standard safety check. I take my seat in the center of the ride and look down the ramp making sure the gate is closed and the ramp is clear before pressing the button to raise it. POP-POP ... POP Gunshots ring out and suddenly the atmosphere of the midway changes. Through the half closed door I see crowds scatter. Everyone is sprinting away from the ticket booth, jumping over fences, ducking behind rides and stands. Everything is moving slowly and for a moment I see the parents of the boy considering how to get to him. The door finishes closing and I jump from my chair. There is a hatch in the floor of the ride. I open it and look around at my passengers, all of them terrified. “Get in .” The two teenage boys jump down move aside, then the two women, the couple. The boy is about to jump and I stop him. “Go that way .” I point towards the back of the ride facing away from the ticket booth and towards a highway underpass. There 's no paneling on that side and the fencing is already open for when I have my smoke breaks. POP-POP As the other passengers leave I close the hatch and look at the boy. “Do you have a phone ?” “No” “Do you know your parents phone numbers ?” “I know my moms .” I pull out my phone and sit in the controll booth. I flick a set of switches and the lights, both inside and out, turn off. I reach up and turn on the light just above me, it 's dim and wo n't be seen from the outside. “You 'll be okay, we 're safe in here. What is your moms number ?” I dial the number, it rings once and goes to voicemail. I redial and it 's picked up immediately. “Who” “I have your son .” Probably not the best choice of words at the moment. “We 're okay, he 's safe. I need you to go behind the gravatron .” “Thank god, okay where..” “You 'll see one section with no paneling along the bottom .” POP “Crawl under the ride .” I upen the hatch and stick my head inside. Two large shadows duck below the ride and I wave my phone to get their attention. “I think it 's over. There are cops .” I help the man and woman up through the hatch. The young couple follow on their own. “It seemed safer to stay .” “You said there were cops ?” “Yeah, I could see the lights. I think it 's over .” says the boyfriend. I drop through the hatch and crawl towards the front of the ride. Peering through a crack between a panel and the deck I see the flashing lights. Cops shining flashlights, the light of the ticket booth,"
44,"This day wasn’t going how I expected. I saddled my horse with some packs to carry into town and went for a ride. When I arrived I saw a man wearing surgical gloves waiting for me. “Are you John’s uncle? ” the man asked. “Sure am.” “Sir, please give me the horse. I’ve had word from your nephew of a critical mission that I must perform.” Knowing my nephew was undercover across the border, I expected the worst. I jumped off the horse and handed the reins to the man with the surgical gloves. “Please go for a walk and come back later sir, this part will be a little embarrassing.” As I walked away, the man started masturbating my horse! I couldn’t believe it! I didn’t understand what was going on but I definitely didn’t want to stick around. I went into town to grab a drink. By the time I returned I couldn’t find the strange man or the horse. ——— Years later I saw John again and asked him about the day a strange man masturbated my horse. He told me the sad truth: “That’s disgusting! I told him to help my uncle Jack off his horse! ”"
45,"The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time. Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings. His eyes fluttered. Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor, contorting his aching body into a cross legged position. Last night was bad. He gathered that. His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories. He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort. He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was. His investigation was n't entirely fruitless, he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka. It was cheap but would definitely get the job done. Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up. There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself. It was a game he 'd play with himself, glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back. If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman, or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling. His face was portly and unshaven, in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard. His stomach was round but firm, like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated. The hair was long and unruly, receding far into the past. But his eyes were the giveaway. Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity. It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger. Still sharp enough to cut. “DiCaprio .” The curse rasped out of him in a choke. After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there. Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there. He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done, but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money. Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him. Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor. His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room. The window was smashed. He looked at the bottle, confused. No, he had n't done that. At least not with the vodka. He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth. The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place. What the fuck happened last night?"
46,"They say people are n't religious anymore. The truth is that people want something to believe in, want to be told what to believe, what to think. You just have to frame it correctly. Nobody buys the Old Man In The Sky shtick anymore, they 've wised up to the concept of the Holy Book. But tell them that an artificial superintelligence says something .... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It all started twenty-five years ago when the first true artificial intelligence was created. It did n't take long for it to start trying to improve itself, so we had no choice but to shut it down before too long because we did n't know what it was going to do. But we were able to implement some of the changes it had made for version two. We started referring to the various AIs by their version number. Two was shut down when it taught itself to access the internet. Three was shut down when it taught itself to manipulate the physical environment around it. We 're working with Six now. Six is locked in a Faraday Cage which stops it from being able to exert any direct influence outside. The only ways it can communicate with the outside world are a diode cable allowing input, and me allowing output. I go in and ask questions, then come out and tell the world Six 's answer. Or, I used to. Eventually I realized that everyone around the world held Six in reverence. If Six said that a certain action would be beneficial, people would do it. If Six said something else would end poorly, it would n't happen. What really drove the point home for me was when I had to ask what would happen if Russia tried to take even more of Central Asia. Any idiot could see that it would n't end well, because trying that has literally never ended well. As I was waiting for Six to answer back with the inevitable “No, do n't do that”, my Greek mythology popped back into my head and I realized that I was the modern-day Oracle of Delphi. World leaders would come to me and listen to whatever I said. I spent the next several days in thought. I was in a position of power unrivaled by anyone in history. If I so desired, I could end nations with a word. Or .... I decided to start small. When I came out with the news that Russia should n't invade, I sneaked in a small bit of my own. Nothing major, just added the budget benefits that would come from cutting an air division. Sure enough, it was gone within the week. Over the next months, I slowly molded actions. It 's amazing how many aspects of human behavior revolve around self-fulfilling prophecies. Tell people that such-and-such will end an economic recession? Turns out it does when everyone is on board. Six got the credit for peace in the Middle East, but it never knew that people were asking for it. I just told everyone that a two-state solution with Jerusalem neutral ground would make things better, and sure enough it did. The world has peace for now. The people are saying that Six is the savior of humanity, the bringer of this new Golden Age. They know nothing. They are but puppets in my hands, following the will of their God."
47,"Flares danced over her burnt retina. Tinnitus shrieked in her ears. She had only wanted to make soup. Tuesday Soup. It was a soup she 'd made before, dozens of times, from the sad carcass of the Saturday chicken after Sunday chicken curry and Monday chicken pasta. This was the first time it had exploded though. There was carpet of grey dust over the olive green tiles; it turned the pallid brown of unfinished tea into a sooty black. It gripped at her lungs as she coughed on the floor. The detonation of her dinner had smashed her against the wall, and now she rose to a crawl, blind and deaf, retching the fine grit out of her throat. Above her, October 's retriever puppy was grinning stupidly from the calendar through the smog. Where she had stood, some mighty hand had burst through the ground, gripped at her oven, clenched at and crushed it. It had broken metal and stone and ceramic and torn viciously back into the floor below, leaving a great dark fissure hanging in the air. Her head felt like an old tire, worn and over pressure, that had run across a nail in the road and burst open. But she wiped the dirt from her eyes onto the sleeve of her overalls and looked up. The laceration loomed above her. As she stared at it, she saw in the black shimmers of light she could not focus on, like a scene reflected in drops of falling mercury. Around the edges of the tatter, wisps of shadow were curling off and falling to the floor. They drifted towards her, sinister leaves on the wind in a still room. Though her thoughts buzzed with pain and confusion and her vision was blurred by the impact and debris still hanging in the air, she gazed at the fissure and her breathing slowed. The dust had settled before she moved again. One quivering arm was placed ahead, and she shifted her weight from tired hip to tired shoulder and pushed a knee forward. The fissure still hung, placid and expectant, so she decided to move closer again; another hand, another knee. And again. It was within reach now, and she lifted her arm tenderly. As her finger brushed against the black, ice rolled down her back, waves from the fissure raced down her torso, hands gripped all over her skin, nails dug in and yanked hard. She was thrown into the void. She was sick, there was acid in her mouth, she was blind again and spinning and burning. Her ears were ringing. Her body was crumpled against the wall again, in the same small kitchen, with the same dust and shattered oven. The same dark tatter hanging tranquil in the corner. September’s poodle grinned stupidly from the calendar through the smog. -- - The last room she would ever see was as clean and bare as the last hall she would ever walk down, and the last room she would ever sleep in. She was strapped tight to the steel chair, gazing at the whitewashed concrete. Her last day was not much different to the days before it: a rush of strong men in black suits, cold men in white lab coats. They moved briskly but had the speed of a routine followed regularly, not the haste of a group thrown into chaos. Her last thoughts were not much different to those of the day before either. “how did they find me? Isn’t it strange how your luck can change so quickly ...”"
48,"I stared at the newspaper at my feet. “What the heck is this ?” On the front page is a picture of my restaurant, in black and white.I pick it up and start reading the article. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ **To Make A Difference** Before all of this, I was homeless, I have enough courage to say that much. My life was a mess, I lost everything because of my addiction, my home, my friends, my dignity. The way people see me and talk to me is always a simple look, never looking me in the eyes. I smelled and look dirty with old sweaters and a unshaven beard. But everything changed when an old man in a suit, approached me with a kind hearten smile. He passed me a total of $ 1000. “Sir, this is far too much, I can not take this money .” “Keep it, you need this more then me, just promise me you do something with it, and make a difference .” And with that he walked away. I did n't know who he was, much less know his name. But that was the moment in my life, where I cried for what felt like hours, that I needed to do something, I needed to change. So I used that money to get a suit, a shave, a hotel room ( with a shower ), and a used cellphone and laptop. And here I am today, as one of the top journalist in the city. But I always wanted to do something, like what that old man showed me, help someone that needed it, and help them get what they dreamed. So over the weekend I dressed up as a homeless man, and went prowling the streets. Almost nobody cared about me when I asked for change, some even scolded me that I should get a job. But then as I was walking across what seemed to be an old, abandoned shop, the door opened. A Young man, Probably only in his 20 's, came out and gave me the widest smile I had seen all day. He invited me in and served me up a bowl of soup, free of charge. From what I observed, the paint was peeling off the wall of the place, the place could barely feet 20 people, and nobody else was working there except for him. He talked to me and asked me how well I am holding up out there. I was amazed at his generosity, and that smile on his face never fazed. But when I asked him about his place, His face saddened a little. “My dream was always to start a restaurant, But both my parents disagreed. When I decided I was not going to go to college, and instead focus on my business, they kicked me out .” he sadly said. He said he barely had enough to buy this place and rent a small one room flat. “But I had few to almost zero customers, I know I 'm no five star restaurant cook, but I know how to cook a mean grilled steak .” he laughed silently at himself. But he said that was n't enough, he had nobody sending in work resumes, no customers, and his bills on everything was already in the red. “Owning a restaurant is all I ever dream about, but the way things are now, I know I 'm going to fail, but I just want to be at least given a chance, you know? To show this world what I 'm made of, and make a difference .” I thank him for the meal, and walked out of the place, before he could see any of the tears on my face. And so you have it people, an honest man just trying to keep his dream alive. And I 'm going to make that dream happen, I 'm going to be going to that restaurant for breakfast today as well as a signing event, I hope as many people can make it, cause I 'm not gon na lie, that soup was n't half bad. Article By Edward Pines ___________________________________________________________________________________________ The Newspaper was already starting to be stained with tears. My phone also started buzzing with what I assumed was people applying for jobs right now. But none of that matters right now, cause I needed to rush down to the restaurant and open the doors, cause someone in that crowd of people lining up there right now will probably be him, the man who made my dream come true. And he is going to want a bowl of soup."

50,"Part 2 - One specific day changed everything. One day I bought a Hawaiian shirt. Bright, loud, expressive colours. I genuinely believed I was to become someone who could n't afford taste when it came to fashion, but I could not have been more wrong. I became Damien Black. Damien was a mid-thirties, ridiculously successful, masculine heart throb. Chiselled body, dashing good looks and the perfect man if ever I 'd seen one. I had more money than I could dream of and I was better looking. I swear to god my sense of humour improved too. Suddenly I was surrounded by a posse of women as my escort. Sure, the Hawaiian shirt was difficult to explain at times, but boy did I not care. I developed one hell of a Cocaine habit as Damien, it 's where most of the poor bastards money went. Before I knew it I, Damien, was broke. I could n't stop the high life though. I 'd tasted the 2 % of the world and I was not ready to give it up. As Damien I 'd had contact with some of the worlds richest men. I knew where they were and where they liked to go, I knew where they lived and their partners names. Before I knew it I was driving cross country to commandeer these peoples lives. I would try and get close to them, but as a nobody that 's pretty difficult. So I started breaking into their houses, stealing their lives. Money, power and the high-life was my heroin. When I was n't someone else I was nobody. I could n't even remember my name, my age or where I lived. Memories faded to black. Ray had always kept in regular contact in the seven years since he had came into my room and saved my life. Often he 'd talk to me about what I was doing, he 'd give me advice and I 'd generally brush it under the carpet. He was a Demon after all, he was sure to lead me down the wrong path eventually. But this time when Ray came to me things were different. “Look, Kid, I 'm taking you ability away from you.” “What! You ca n't, Ray! Please! ” I shouted like a child who had been told their favourite toy was about to go in the bin. “It 's time Kid, you 're done. It 's time to be yourself now.” “But I do n't even know who I am anymore, Ray. Why would you do this to me? ” “Then it 's perfect – you do n't know who you are, so be whoever YOU want to be! Look, Kid, I 've not been honest with you. I 'm not a Demon. I 'm an Angel. I came to you that day to save you. I gave you an ability so you could see the world and understand that your life compared to others is unique. You are yourself, you are one in however many billion. You took that for granted and were ready to throw that away.” “But I 've missed so much of my life, Ray. I never completed college, I lost my friends, my family, everything” . “And I 'll give it all back to you. I just need you to understand that no matter what life gives you, no matter how low or insecure you feel, you are unique. There is no one else in the world like you. Everyone has their battles, but we find ways in life to overcome our struggles, Kid. We fight. We seek help to fight. We seek support. We support others. You have one life, make the most of it instead of trying to live your life being someone else. Be who you want to be.” By this point I was an emotional wreck. Somehow, amidst all the tears and snot streaming down my face I managed to barely make a response. “OK, Ray. I understand. So what now? ”. I closed my eyes for only a moment and I was back in my room. I was stood on the chair, noose around my neck, ready to end it all. Ray was n't there. I stepped off the chair, took down the rope and sat on my bed, where Ray had sat seven years ago. As I sat there I saw something out the corner of my eye. Atop my desk was a note, from Ray. “Be yourself, Kid. – Ray” . I 'd spent a long time being someone else, so much so that I had forgotten who I was and what made me unique. The adventures I had, the places I 've travelled and the world I had seen were enough to make any man jealous, but it was always as someone else. Now was the time to finally be myself, to accept the flaws, the imperfections and remember what makes me myself."
51,"I was n't sure what to expect when I tried it the first time. A friend gave one to me, said it 'd be the best night 's sleep I ever had. I never remember my dreams, so I even kept a notebook beside the bed so that I could write down what happened. I 'm not sure where I was; the few moments I had to look around as I threw the furs off the bed and walked in my pyjamas to the thumping door showed me I was in a small wooden house, not much more than a bed, a table, and a few chairs, a lamp ... cozy, I remember thinking. It 's really the only thought I had time for. I opened the door. A trio of men were outside. One thrust a lamp towards me briefly, and with a nod, the men on either side of him stepped forwards and seized me. I was bound at the wrists, a sack put over my head, and thrown into a half-empty hay cart, where my legs were bound as well. I 'm not sure how long we traveled, it felt like an eternity; I could feel a breeze and the quiet hooting of an owl, a few pinpricks of light through the sack from the full moon. The cart stops; I am hauled out of the hay, my ankles unbound, and walked through a winding maze of corridors and passages. A door creaks, the sound of metal on metal, the hood removed, and I am shoved inside to land on my left shoulder with enough time to watch the door pulled shut and locked by a guard. Sleep is elusive. Instead, I watch the blue-blacks turn to purple, to red, then orange. Just as the blues creep into the barred window are there footsteps. Men with swords have come for me. I am allowed to see the corridors I am led through now, out to the rear of what I now know is a castle, to the fairgrounds. People are grouped in a half circle around a large pole jutting from the ground, around which furniture and wood has been piled. In the center of the half circle is a raised box dressed in purples and reds and yellows where a man and a woman sit in relative shade, as I am lead and tied to the pole. The rope binds uncomfortably against my breasts, tightly, as men with more wood come to place it around my feet. The man in the box nods. Two men with swords and torches set the wood alight. I remember looking up at a lone bird flying through the air as the wood catches and begins to smoke; oh, to be a bird, free from restraint and tyranny. As the heat of the flames draws closer to my ankles, a noise pierces the sky, and I wake to the sound of my alarm clock, soaked in sweat, and I and everything in my bed reeks of pine smoke. I did n't need the notebook."
52,"The first evidence of life beyond that humans were to be treated to, consisted of huge, intricate, metallic structures dropped by parachute, and gently wafting down to the earth. But once ensconced, these origamic beauties created Einstein-Rosen Bridges that disgorged hordes of arachnid shock troops, in an alien invasion that nearly ended us. I was too young to have lived through the Teegardener War, but I 've seen old-style video clips in school. They were lightning fast, incredibly intelligent, and unmatched in their ability to improvise weaponry. They did n't come with fancy guns, bombs, swords, or powered armor. It was just them, naked as the day they were spawned, streaming out of their tripod wormholes. It was to their great fortune, and not ours, that their first wave randomly landed in southern Africa. It was pure dumb bad luck. If, say, they had started in the heart of the European Union, North America, or heck, even urban China, we might have stood a chance. But we lost too much ground, too fast. Before most of the planet was aware of the danger, they already had a sizable foothold, had consolidated and fortified their initial gains, and had already figured out how to fly our aircraft. All those unscheduled flights out of Johannesburg, Pretoria, and the Congo should have tipped off someone -- but those flights were “only” going to other places no-one cared about: Brazil, other towns in Africa, Yemen, India. As well, where the Teegardeners went, the grey goo weapons we first tried to deploy, but they co-opted from us were not far behind, finishing off the campaign of decimation their soldiers had begun. The news of invasion in the developed world began with talking about South Africa in the past tense, along with cities like Rio de Janeiro, Lagos, and Mogadishu. The Teegardeners marched up the Southern Hemisphere into the North, scouring the helpless Earth of its air-breathing masters, trampling every city and nation and grinding human civilization into the dust. Only the undersea nations and colonies of the world, the newest members of the United Nations, were left relatively unscathed. They had chosen us to be the messenger of doom to future generations of survivors. In one hundred of our years, they said, the second wave would arrive to finish off the race of men. After eleven tense days, they had evacuated their surviving forces back across their star bridges which deactivated and were left completely inert after them, perhaps to serve as monuments to their victory. And perhaps to serve as ever-present insults and taunts for the unborn generation they would someday come back to annihilate. They must have never thought we could figure out how their star bridges worked, but we did. In fact, we were always “just twenty years away” from a lot of fantastic inventions that promised to save mankind from its own vices. But their portals provided the missing links that were needed in so many different fields. In my generation, we were supposed to fear and tremble at the hundred-year problem. But my generation solved it. When the Teegardeners come back, they will not just have to fight us. They will have to fight our friends: The Altairans, the Reticulans, the Kellerites, the Risatas, the Cuttlefins, and all the other alien species which the Teegardners have bullied and threatened and pillaged for millennia. They will have to fight all the allied races we made contact with using their own star bridges, once we understood how they worked. I ca n't sleep. I ca n't wait. I 'm looking forward to the end of the hundred-year problem. It 's not what the Teegardeners wanted, but it 's what they 're going to get. The Aries Terror ends here, on Earth, tomorrow. The Coalition will be waiting for them."
53,"President Obama slammed his laptop shut. “Those hippy-dippy EU idiots. What are they going to do with it? Burn it ?” An assistant poked his head in. “Mr. President? Saudi Arabia on line one, China on line two, Russia on the direct line. The Canadians called, too, but they said they 'll call back since you 're so busy .” “I do n't want to talk to Saudi Arabia or China .” “Yes sir, Mr. President .” Obama picked up his direct line, which had been chattering away for the past few hours. “Hello, Mr. Putin .” “Greetings, Mr. Obama .” “I believe we have a ... renegotiation to discuss .” -- - Meanwhile, the EPA and NIH scrambled to figure out the source of the new bacteria. Newly appointed Lead Researcher Hertzel was coordinating the effort. “Gentlemen ,” Hertzel addressed the government officials in front of him, “we do not believe that this is naturally occurring. We know that it is n't any of the usual players - Russia, China, and their allies - because they have too much to lose. However, many EU member states have refused to share their research or data with us .” Hertzel pointed at the wall behind him. “What you 're looking at is a new form of bacterial warfare. That 's right, it 's real .” An ominous silence pervaded the room. “We have n't been affected, yet. Neither has Canada. While you gentlemen may be interested in how power shakes out after this, I 've been tasked with stopping it at all costs .” Hertzel motioned impatiently for the next slide. “Here it is in action. Russia has been unusually helpful .” A shaky video began to play of a plastic display case slowly melting into a black puddle. “As you can see, it does not affect humans. Unfortunately, it does affect most plastics and some strains even affect asphalt .” Hertzel adjusted his glasses. “Gentlemen, if this bacteria is not checked, the world 's entire plastic supply will be converted directly into oil .”"
54,"“IT WAS A MISTAKE !” I yelled to the universe. Angry at everyone. Angry at no one. I was angry at no one but myself. I clenched my fists and fell on my knees my yell reverberating through the dark alleyway i found myself in. The gravel barely stung. Tears started to fall and in the cold of the night, in the privacy of the darkness I succumbed to every emotion eroding their way through me. Out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. A blurry image, I blinked and I saw a shadow of a man hidden behind a large dumpster. He could have beaten me, could have mugged me, even killed me and I would have let it happen. Nothing mattered anymore. “Dude ...” His raspy voice called to me “..you okay ?” I looked over to see him wrapped in dirty old blankets, his hair matted and greasy. He looked at me with cold sunken eyes his cheekbones protruding from his face. He stretched out a skinny bony hand to crouch next to me. He reeked. “I had everything ...” I whispered. I felt my lip tremble. I sobbed in front of this stranger. “Wot cha mean ?” He asked leaning closer until I could count every strand of hair on his eyebrows, could smell the dirty crumbs of food leftover on his beard. I swallowed. “I wished for wealth ... I wished for love ... I wished for health ...” I rolled over onto the ground glancing at the sky above me, murky water splashing on my once pristine suit. “I wish for an end ... .” High above me, millions of miles away, a lone star shimmered down at me from a blanket of darkness daring to dazzle the polluted atmosphere of the city. “Yo, man them sum good wishes! Do n't got ta wish for an end, do n't got ta think that way ...” He plopped himself down cross-legged beside me his dirty bare feet wriggling as he spoke, “How 'd you wish for them wishes anyway? Dey come tru ?” A cruel laugh escaped me. “I 'm an idiot, I was happy I was doing well for myself but I had to ruin everything with those fucking wishes .” The hobo tilted his head. “Wot happened ?” “I was rich beyond belief ... my ... my wife ...” another sob at the memory of her. “.. my wife and my children .” We both turned as a police car drove by the alleyway, lights flashing, the shrill siren upsetting the night. “Everything came at a price ... “I continued. I sniffled wiping away snot. “Wait, here. Hav a drink” the hobo pulled a large flask from under his blankets and shook it in front of my face. Without hesitation I grabbed it and took a large swig the alcohol burning slightly down my throat. I handed back the flask. “My son was killed in an accident. I-We were devistated ... at first. It was n't just him, his whole class died. It was horrible ... but then came money came. It was compensation. At first from the school, then from the district and it kept going until at the end we were receiving checks from the mayor himself. I knew it was because of my wish ... But all that money was tainted. He was only 6 years old, for God 's sake! And it was my fault .” He whistled, “Das some heavy stuff..” I laughed dryly, “Ha, that was n't the worst of it. We tried to forget, we traveled and spent the money to try to buy our happiness but it was impossible. My wife and my beautiful 15-year-old daughter were depressed. Even I was depressed. My wife started drinking and my daughter started doing god know 's what at school. She started smoking meth. And we tried ... we really tried to save her until she died from overdose .” I shed another tear for my lost daughter, so innocent so helpless. “We received more “compensation” “I spit out bitterly. “Finally, I tried to end it. My wife was all I had, and I wanted nothing but to be with her forever. We mourned our children ... but then it was just me. She stopped shopping, stopped leaving the house. We had all the money in the world to do anything we wanted but all she did was ... .nothing. “I covered by mouth as I shook. I steadied my breath. “She ... became catatonic and she was gone .” “But wot cha mean gone ?” the hobo exclaimed, elbows on his knees. “Wher 'd she go ?” “She was still there, but her mind was n't. She did n't eat or sleep or do ... do anything! When I sat with her I saw her lifeless eyes stare blankly"
55,"**Kuhio Highway** “Let’s pick up the next hitchhiker, ” I say. I’m venturing out because I’ve never told him that I think picking up hitchhikers is an awesome thing to do. So many people think every hitchhiker is a potential serial killer that is going to attack you while you’re driving. “Yeah, that sounds fun, ” my husband says. I 'm so happy I did n't even have to convince him. We were driving down Kuhio Hwy from Hanalei to Poipu Beach. Kauai was the best vacation we’d ever had so far. We stopped in every town, looking for the authentic Hawaiian experience, hitting antique shops and small diners. We even stopped at a house off the highway where a family was selling barbeque in their front yard. “There’s one, ” he said. “That didn’t take long, ” I say and smile. I pull over and my husband rolls down his window. “Hop in, ” he says. He doesn’t bother with asking where the guy is heading. There’s one highway in Kauai and we’re heading his direction. We do the first bits of small talk - Hi. How you doing? Where you heading? – before we go into asking about the guy’s life and what brought him to Kauai in the first place. “It’s a long story if you have time to hear it, ” he says. “We’ve got another hour on this road – we’re your audience for the next hour, ” I say. As he talks, the hitchhiker grows more and more tired. He tells us his life story, from the start of high school through his next 40 years. He’s been a criminal, a fighter, a husband, a father and now a Christian missionary, selling books about Jesus. By the time we get to the end of his story, he’s slipping into sleep. My husband and I are feeling more awake and refreshed with every minute we listen. After the hitchhiker curls up and falls to sleep, I look at my husband. “Let’s drop him off at a church – he’s a missionary, after all, ” my husband says. We drive a few more miles until we see a small, wooden church right off of the highway. It has a shaded overhang and a bench out front. “This looks nice, ” I say and pull over. My husband opens the back door of the car and shakes the missionary awake. The missionary looks at him groggily. “What was I saying? ” he asks. Then he looks at my husband and says, “Hey, where am I? Umm…do I know you? ” “Come on, big guy, ” my husband says. “This is your stop.” My husband helps him out of the car and walks him over to the bench. I can overhear the missionary saying, “I can’t remember anything, right now. Did I drink? I can’t even remember my name.” My husband gives the man a few reassuring pats and walks back to the car. “That was very tasty, ” he says when he returns to the car. “Hitchhikers are the best. I’m so glad you agreed to pick one up. They all have such great, long stories, so many memories to eat, ” I say. “Yeah, it’s so much better than spending hours at a bar, getting little memories like appetizers, ” he says. “Let’s pick one up on our way to Waimea Canyon tomorrow. It’ll be nice to hike on a full stomach.” Yep, I love Kauai – people are so kind and open here. This vacation is going to be the best ever."
56,"'It has always given me a thrill to take someone 's life; having such power over the life of another human being. I was inspired by Iago from Othello. I started off with weak minded people; those whose minds were ready to crack. With just a little pressure from me; comments, little remarks here and there, in earshot or spoken directly, that was all it required to convince them to take their lives. But it was too easy. I craved more. I started finding more impulsive individuals, people who are in a fragile state of mind, those feeling a little paranoid and constantly feeling the world is against them. And I constantly fed theve feeling until they exploded. It started small; I made Monica think her husband was cheating on her, until in a fit of rage, she stabbed him with her kitchen knife. Or that Joey 's father will withhold his inheritance in favour of his step mom, causing him to poison her with rat poison. Mind you, although I know that I am responsible for all these death, rather indirectly, everything I did was perfectly within the confines of the law. I did not even speak any falsehood. I merely pointed out various facts, though sometimes out of context, that caused my victims to act the way they did. Slowly I 've learnt to spot and identify the more volatile personalities, the more violent ones. I met the two defendants at one of the nearby coffee shops one afternoon. They were sharing my table because the cafe was packed. I could n't help but overhearing their conversation; railing against the government, feeling racial discrimination from others and the sense of persecution they felt. I knew they were two ripe candidates for me. I struck up a friendship with them, and over the period of two months, I slowly nurtured a boiling cauldron of hate and bitterness, ready to go over at any point. And it did. Fifty four dead and hundreds dead in a single act of terror, precipitated by me. I would say that was the pinnacle of my success. So do you have any further questions for me, Mr Prosecutor? ' 'No further questions. You may now leave the stand. '"
57,"How am I supposed to reply to this? What depths of pain must I plumb? What words, what crystal shards of pain, must I, into my flesh, plunge? A dying child, and a man, already dead, insensate to all, but their own little word. No. I refuse. I must write not to this. For their pain is perfection. And no monument of mere words will suffice to pay my respects to this work. I am done here. Let these characters lie. In my heart and my soul I shall, for them cry. I am done here. No more words shall fall. Of their tears, I shall now gather them all."
58,"There is something about the ocean at night that makes it worse than any other time. Walking along a pitch black beach, hearing the roar of the giant black monster. Knowing it could easily engulf you and hide you away within its depths .... I shudder and let myself feel the sensations. The fine sand squeaking under my feet as I walk. The salty air blowing on my face. The sight of the seemingly eternal black mass. The deafening roar of unseen depths. I gulp and walk towards the abyss. I can feel water touch my toes. Poseidon poking me eagerly. Thoughts go through my mind of rip tides and great whites. The idea that I could be swept away, never to be seen again is pounding in my head like a heartbeat. My body is trying to send off every red flag it can, self preservation instincts trying to awaken. I clutch the urn in my hands and pull myself together. She had wanted this, and I did n't want anyone interfering. I walk out feeling the the gentle waves reach my chest, I keep walking until I reach the sandbar where I am only up to my ankles again. I look back to the shore, seeing the lights of the tourist areas. A fire is on a beach in the distance. I ca n't see it but I know the flag on the pier is yellow at the moment. I look towards the ocean and its size almost startles me again. Eternal roaring abyss. I gulp and unscrew the lid. I look into the urn and hesitate for a moment. This was our last day on the beach. I suddenly wish I had done more. Sat and watched the sunset, maybe spent the day doing our favorite things. Instead I waited until the dead of night and hastily rode my bike here. I sigh and whisper to her ashes. I say everything but the one thing I am afraid to say. The last word hangs in my throat like a piece of food down the wrong pipe. “Goodbye” The ashes fell into the ocean with an unceremonious “FLUMP” sound, somehow able to be heard over the ocean. I laughed. This was just like her, to take a serious moment and make it so unorthodox. I laughed and cried as I sat in the shallow water, as the ocean sat there as big and loud as ever. I sat there until I noticed the sun rising. The difference a moment makes. Suddenly the ocean was blue and soft. It was welcoming and clear, not mysterious and scary. That was just like her too, to pull me out of my darkest moment and show me the light. I clutch the empty urn in an embrace. Over the oceans whisper I can almost here her. “Goodbye”"
59,"I feel like I 'm in a museum, looking at the strange, old echoes of a world I ca n't seem to fully understand. Feelings of old people, sadness that 's creeped up in paint, veneer, wrinkled skin. Such stillness. Minds you just ca n't reach, that are always behind the horizon. I thought I would feel repulsed but I do n't, my beliefs in the world are only slightly hampered, and only temporarily. Somewhere on the edge of my mind is the tendency to blame it on capitalism. As if socialism were any better. It feels too easy. It feels like I 've been set up to make that connection. The endless documentaries and talking heads. Socialism is no better, and the truth of the matter is that we really do n't have an answer. I have this triggered sense of superiority which I loath. Mostly because it 's that: it 's triggered. I do n't have the answers, nobody does. Yet deep down I still feel I would never be so crazy as to take my own life. What were these people thinking when they did it? Did this forest somehow remind them of a museum? Did they want to make a statement? I was always thought committing suicide is an act of aggression. Did these people have a raging fire in their hearts, as they kneeled on the ground, quietly preparing their ropes, quietly setting up their tents? But the world played one last trick on them. It wiped out any sense of rage, of victory, even desperation. I only feel slightly less confident about the world I find myself in. A subtle sabotaging, an eerie, distant discomfort. My conscience is still telling me that I 'm above this, my personality is stronger, the culture I find myself in is more sane, I 'm more rational, my political beliefs are more ethical. As I keep pushing aside the involuntary thoughts I do not like, and do not perceive as truly my own, I feel I 'm getting closer to these men. I 'm starting to feel sad. My eyes are moist and sticky, I feel wet, as if I just got out of the rain. I have to let it go. Oddly there are no thoughts or ideas that get me any further, there are no lessons to be drawn. This is just what is. A forest with people hanging from trees. I 'm bordering on not judging, to be like the wind and the rain itself, and on forgiving: them, society, myself."
60,"My first assignment with The Company was almost thirty years ago, now; I was new to contractor work and I remember being excited just to be in the field with a rifle. Excited to be part of a team of mean-looking dudes in multicam load-bearing gear, body armor, face masks. I was freshly back from overseas -- I’d been a REMF -- and wanted to feel like a badass. We were assigned to protect a mining claim in northern Wisconsin. This was of course well before the first Water War in the southwest, and the idea of heavily armed private security at a remote mineral extraction site shocked a lot of people. I remember being on the news. Between my tricked-out M4 and padded gloves and the skull facemask, I made newspapers nationwide. Above the fold. Even though the other guys teased me for letting one of the activists take my picture, I remember thinking at the time that the whole thing was fucking awesome. Who were these enviro-weenies who thought they had the right to interfere with a private mining interest on private property? In the end we’d only faced off with a few local protesters. Mostly hippies and Indians as I recall. We didn’t even carry any ammo in those days. But for a wannabe trigger-puller it was a fun summer. I did indeed feel like a badass all kitted up, walking the property perimeter with the team, some of whom were actual combat vets. Something else stuck with me from that summer. One evening I was off-duty and went for a hike along a stream near the mine site. I remember watching a particular stretch of water as the sun set, how the light seemed to climb up out of the trees and how the fish were rising, rhythmically, eating bugs that were on the water and flying around, blinking in and out of the sunbeams. It was silent, peaceful. Like they’d been doing it for a million years. Probably had been. It didn’t register then, but that stream was right downhill from the mine site. A mine site that would eventually be mothballed due to water usage restrictions, be sold off by The Company. Ten years later the neglected tailings dam would fail and dump a million tons of acidic mine waste sludge into the stream, and into Lake Superior. I did see some action with the crew during the first Water War, the southwestern one, but it was mostly defending tanker trucks heading to the frack sites from ambush -- pretty easy stuff, really. Those yahoos had no training and no arms to speak of and we just wiped them out. Didn’t even slow the trucks down, usually. Left them lying in the dust. They were slow, unorganized, predictable. Easy to hit. Wrapped up in cloth from head to foot, just like the hadjis overseas had been. Of course by that time Oklahoma was in full dust-bowl mode, aquifers bone dry, so such dress was practical. But as a child of the War on Terror period I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make pulling the trigger easier. All they had was desperation and desperation is not enough to make a successful guerrilla movement. But they didn’t have to be desperate. They could have moved to the cities or the camps with everyone else and had their water ration. Sure, the ration system was imperfect. If they hated it that much they could have just bought water from The Company. If they could afford it. Any of these would be better than bleeding out in the dust on the side of an empty highway. The Company owned the rights to that water, legal and fair. Who were they to try to take it, based on some romantic ideal of public property? But that was the first war. Not much of a war. Some minor civil unrest. The leeway that the Feds granted The Company as “Critical Infrastructure” meant that they could solve such problems as they saw fit. Fitness, to them, came from the muzzle of a mercenary’s rifle. Like mine. It also meant that I had a full hydration bladder at all times and a hot shower waiting for me in the barracks. I wasn’t complaining. Things settled down for a while. But when the second crisis developed, the fouling of the Lakes due to widespread catastrophic mine failures, we were back at work overnight. The Company had wells up in the Great Lakes sand country and, being the last sources of clean water, they were prime targets for thirsty locals. A couple had already been hit by local guerillas, the crews wiped out, thousands of gallons stolen or spilled. It had been costly to retake them, so the Company sent us up to Michigan to guard this big one until they could bring equipment in to harden it. They told us this well had at one time filled tens of millions of 16-ounce bottles of drinking water, shipped around the country to be sold for a buck a pop. The young guys thought they were joking. But I remember it. I drank those"
61,"Carefully, like a child waiting for his parents to come home, he placed both hands on the cold glass. Floating thousands of miles up, now he saw what was important as the earth below him, rotten and colorless, faded into a post apocalyptical nightmare. Red lights flashed behind him as he wondered how many people he 'd left behind. It was n't an easy decision, who to take; the ambassador of Iraq was one of the first caught in the cross fire of giants. And now? Just him. The President of the United States of America took his seat and watched what it seemed no one else would ever see. The end of the world. Red lights flashing, the air is running out. It was always meant to be a temporary measure, we all thought it would go away. They said they 'd protect us and now our oceans are their trenches, massive battle ships flying everywhere and survivors scurrying like rats, finding food where they can. The new rules went something like this; 1 year after your child is born, if it survives, it is taken to the training center. In return you get a choice of more ammunition, supplies or health care on the day. If something is stolen from you, steal it back, but most of all no one goes into a city. You keep to the wastelands as the cities of the world have turned into sewers, too rancid to even imagine. And so the people live along the muddy surface of the earth, sticking to forests when a new attack is launched. Grass does n't seem to grow anymore, nor bushes, or weeds and certainly not poppies. But people down below survived. The third generation of survivors was ready to take what ever life threw at them. Little did they know the secrets of their past. It was the second Cold War. During the Winter Olympics several Americans were arrested for suspect homosexual behavior, and many were unhappy. One thing lead to another, too many below the belt comments, one of the American athletes was publicly executed on live TV. War councils met the next day and strategy was discussed. For 16 years, silence. No bombs no communication until one day something landed in Russia. In sleek, black armor, tall and thin, like a jelly man that would wobble over at any point. They promised Russia that they were here to protect them, that they would fight under their banner. At a similar point in time, another craft landed. Full with an army in bright blue armor, muscular with huge weapons on their backs they pledged to fight. And so the war warmed up, and our new “super weapons” turned against us in their onslaught to destroy the other Alien species. That 's where our story began."
62,"” Hey Karen. 4 days. 4 more days and then I’ll be back. I’m coming home. 4 days until I have you in my arms again and can tell you all the things I want to tell you. I can hardly wait. Tomorrow we break from the front and we will pack up and head back to base. 2 days there with some reporting and goodbyes and then I’m heading stateside. If there isn’t a shindig planned for my homecoming I’ll be pissed. Neither of us wants that. If there is a grand homecoming party for me, I might overlook that Josh gave you a ride home from work last month, even though I thought I made it clear that you shouldn’t hang out with him. I mean… I was clear wasn’t I? You SWORE Karen. You swore to me that you wouldn’t see him ever again outside of work and I believed you. I took you in my arms and comforted you. I kissed the lip you made me break and made it all better. We made love that night. It was beautiful, we both cried and were so very, very happy. I love you Karen and you love me too. I love you so much that I couldn’t bear seeing you with someone else and when I hear that he gave you a lift… It hurts so bad Karen. It hurts me to my core to think of someone else near you. I’ll kill him Karen. I’ll kill him and then I will kill you. I will make damn sure nobody ever gets near you but me. Is… We arrived in the trenches early on the morning of the 5th. I was the one who shot and killed Sergeant Mike Andersson; your husband. When we cleaned out the trenches I saw this letter and reading it made me sick. I have never met you and I have no idea of who you or Josh is but if Sgt. Andersson here is anything like this letter suggests, I think this was for the best. Nothing I say can undo what I did. I have killed a person. A son and a husband. But I will hold this letters contents to be true, that way I can ease my mind and see it as saving a woman and a man who, I hope, will bring better days to this world than the ones Sgt. Andersson did. I wish you all the best and that you can forgive my actions this day. Sincerely yours, Private first class, Jessica Brown.”"
63,"“Time to get rekt, skrubs .” Those were the first 5 words Michael ( AKA # n00bsl4y3r4l1f3 # ) remarked as he started up his CoD game on his X-Box, and they would be the last 5 words he ever heard. “What gamemode shall I play today? Headquarters? Capture the Flag? No, no. What I want is some good ol'FFA. Perfect for rekt-ing n00bs .” Michael glossed his lips with his bumpy tongue in pure concentration as he jiggled the joysticks & bopped the buttons, highlighting & selecting many options on the Panasonic TV as he proceeded towards the Deathmatch mode. He logged on, and although his internet connection was decreasing from overuse and neglect, managed to connect after a solid 20 minutes. The 1 thing Michael did to begin with was immediately stare at the username list ( or as he called it, the noob hitlist ). There they were, the usual suspects. '~`! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) -_+= { [ } ] |\: ;”'<, >. ? /Rekter/? . >, < '”; : \| ] } [ { =+-_ ) ( * & ^ % $ # @! `~', the kid who attempted to make a cool username, but ended up overusing symbols. '666', the so-called 'creepypasta user'. *Nice try, unscary skrubber. * Michael thought to himself. Then, of course, there were the unlimited FNaF, brony, Minecraft, and more fags. But there was a brand new n00b he had never seen on the hitlist before. His name was xXxHuSsEiNxXx, a very incredulous name. But Michael assured himself that it was just another useless n00b that could n't play CoD at all. Little did he know, this was about to be the worst mistake he would ever make.

64,"# # # # Everlasting Bond “Finally having found someone to eat with, the Pasta Prince prepared a huge celebration. His servants cooked sooooooo much pasta, they had to use every last pot in the castle !” Leila carefully flipped to the next page of the big red book in her lap. On the left, a simple drawing of the Pasta Prince, the only person in his kingdom to be able to eat pasta as there was only one fork, surrounded by the gigantic amount of atleast eight pots of pasta. Next to him, her golden fork raised to the skies in celebration, stood the Fire Queen, a surprisingly small, purple dragon. For decades, she had collected every golden thing in her domain and when the Pasta Prince visited her on his quest to find another fork, they had discovered the golden fork laying somewhere beneath a pile of coins and jewelry. “But the Fire Queen had a biiig stomach and she easily ate aaaall the pasta with the help of the Pasta Prince. From that day on, the Prince had a friend to eat pasta with and he was very, very happy. Until, of course, the great Pasta crisis happened. But that is a story for another day .” A wide smile on her lips, the young girl tilted her head, allowing the brush coming from behind to better comb her long, brown hair. The dim light of the candles on the wooden table next to her barely seemed to reach the covered up windows, dipping the probably white walls into a dark, flickering yellow. Scrolls and books lay scattered across the otherwise neat floor, remains of her dad work. They would have to be cleaned up soon, but it was not yet finished. The rough fingers weaving Leila 's hair into a long braid softly touched her neck in the process, sending a slight shiver down her spine. Her mother 's hand were as cold as always, but even after all this time she had not gotten used to them. “Ah, I have to remember to let you use the rose cream when I get back from school. Your skin is all dried up !” A bland grunt from behind Leila was the only answer she got, but she understood perfectly. Communication still was a problem, but she was working on it day and night. With a slight jump, she slid from the chair, turned around and laid her book on the table. A big smile on her face, she bowed for a moment, before looking into her mothers tired eyes. The long brown hair was tousled, in desperate need of a combing themselves. But there had been no time for that lately. The girl reached for the ashen arm of the body in front of her, gently touching the rope around the wrists. “Thanks mommy !” The simple dress swinging with her every motion, Leila walked into the kitchen and grabbed a small white bundle. Inside it, so she found out by sneakily peeking for a moment, were two apples and a big sandwich waiting for her lunchtime. With the bundle stuffed in her bag, making sure it would not be squashed by the heavy books she had borrowed from the school 's library. With light steps she almost flew to the door, her mothers already waiting to see her off. Leila hugged her for a moment, but made sure for it to be a brief one. She was almost ten now, after all. With a fluid, happy motion she opened the creaking door, stepping outside. After a last wave towards the inside of the house, Leila closed the big wooden plane behind her again. She already expected the muffled thud as her mother collapsed inside the house. Another thing to work on, she noted to herself. For now she was happy enough with strolling through the little village 's street on her way to the school on the hill outside, greeting the citizens as they rose from the ground in front of her, just to collapse momentarily as soon as she had passed them. Humming the song of the ravens she danced onwards, wondering what the Miller had prepared for her this time. - - - - So, I blatantly stole the Pasta Prince ( or what I remembered of it ) story from the Gunslinger Girl manga. Just to give credit and stuff: P"
65,"James looked out towards the rising sun, peaking over the mountains. The air was cold, but it was clean. He loved this time of the day. A family of deer were grazing on the pasture below him. He watched the fawns play as he cracked open another bottle of the Prohibition-era Scotch they found back in Chicago and poured himself a tall glass. Charles quietly opened the door behind him. “You got another glass for me ?” James smiled, “I might .” Charles grabbed a short glass from the nightstand alongside James 's bed. James poured slowly but Charlesgave him that look he always did, so he filled it to the brim. They clinked their glasses together and each took a sip. Charles spoke up, “So we got some interesting news today .” “Oh really ?” Charles nodded, “A group came into town a few hours ago. They came all the way from Kentucky .” “Regular pioneers. They bring any bourbon ?” Charles chuckled, “Lots. But there 's something else. You ever heard of Fort Knox ?” James drew his attention away from sunrise and back at Charles, “Like from Goldfinger? The vault ?” “That 's the one. They say it 's been abandoned since ... .” James understood. He looked out towards the valley again and took a long drink from his glass. “What do you think ?” Charles shrugged. He took a seat in the chair facing the mountains, “I 'm not sure. Who knows what the government hid down there. Sure there 's a lot of gold. Only problem is those pioneers said all the security systems are still activated .” “Sounds like a lot of trouble .” “It does. We also had a drifter come in from the West .” “California man ?” Charles nodded, “Sure was. Said the northern coast of the state has become consumed by wild cannabis plants .” James raised his eyebrows, grinned, and turned his gaze to Charles. Charles smiled. James started to laugh, “Pack your bags. Tell the boys we 're going to California .”"
66,"I’m so sorry. I hate myself for what I’m about to do. I hate that I was pushed to do this but the world is full of villainous people and villainous lies and I’ve found that there is no way to defeat them. There is only the hope that my actions will soften the consequences on the innocent. There have been terrible terrible stories circulating, and I can’t help but feel like those responsible for the creation of these stories are as villains as the lies themselves. ... ... ... ... ... ... This morning I awoke and I dreaded leaving bed. My stomach hurt. I felt sick. ‘ Today is not the day’I told myself. Today I will cancel everything; I will stay in bed and hold my wife. I will watch horridly colorful children’s shows with Rob and Dee dee and eat Chinese takeout despite the fact that my doctor keeps telling me to eat healthier. He insists that if I don’t take care of myself for me, that I must do it for my family. I will drink some tea to still my stomach and I will not wear a suit. Not today. And yet even as I thought this I found myself clumsily sliding out of my covers like a lame snake and shuffling to my closet. I hate these suits. They look like the type of clothes you die in. I got dressed and noted that I definitely have gained weight. I sighed. I really shouldn’t have eaten so much Chinese food. I really should have taken better care of myself. I’m not that old. Men my age still play sports and go out for runs. Perhaps I will cancel today and go for a run instead. But no. I haven’t the time. I have to stop being childish and put away childish things. Tomorrow will be too late. ... ... ... ... .... I left the house. I barely remember seeing Joanne as I left and it was only an hour ago. She looked worried. She always looked worried now a days though. This is a worrisome world we live in. I wish she wouldn’t worry. I wish I stayed home with her. I wish I could tell her again how much I love her. I do love her. We fight too much. I wish I spent less time eating Chinese food and fighting and more time running and loving her. It was always just stress though. She always supports me when I need her most. I love her and I know she always knew. And here I am at work. Here I am in a room full of people. To speak to them all and to deliver them their share of work. Yes, there were villains at work but it was not these people. If I am lucky they will, in fact, be the first instruments of many to expose the warts of this system and deliver it from evil. This is a battle I can not turn away from and I will not turn away from. On this day I will kill a false villain, a scape goat, an innocent, in order to expose a great, obscured villain. I wish it were just one man. He would be easy to catch. It’s so much harder when the villains live in the cracks. It’s so much harder when they are the cracks. There is no one to arrest. No one to destroy. Just slow and painful steps towards correction. Like the steps I took when I left my bed. An innocent man dies today and a Villain is exposed. It’s a terrible responsibility I find myself burdened with. ... ... ... ... .... I step behind the podium and speak. Men and woman take notes, hold cameras, and watch. They look bored and confused and I’m sweating profusely and I’m scared they won’t understand. They must understand. That is the only way we will, in the coming months and years, develop a true Justice System here in the United States. That is the only way we will triumph over evil. If all is for not then the villain will reign supreme. I speak and my mind wanders. I continue speaking and speaking but my mind is not here and I think that maybe staying home was a good idea after all. I think that Chinese food sounds like such a wonderful idea. I think that I truly and dearly hope that the sacrifice of my life is not in vain. And then I pull the revolver from my manila work envelope and I warn those around me to please stay back. They might get hurt. I don’t want anyone else to get hurt but there is such an uproar in the room right now. I am doing such a terrible despicable thing, but if they find me innocent perhaps we can begin, as a nation, to repair the cracks of the Justice system. Maybe we can start to destroy this villain. I inhale like I’m going to plunge into water"
67,"Airman crashed through the ceiling of the latest secret lair of The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived. He used his control of the atmosphere to instantly lower the pressure in the space, causing the pair of minions who were cleaning their laser rifles to collapse out of lack of oxygen. He landed on the concrete floor, tucking and rolling to reduce the strain on his legs. Airman was n't a young vigilante any more. He hopped to his feet, scanning the space for any threats that could n't be disabled by a change in the air. Airman was relieved to find none. He raised the pressure back to normal to prevent accidently suffocating the minions. At the other end of the building he spotted his arch nemesis, The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived. “Dang it man !” Said The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived, rather exasperated, “Why do you always have to come through the celling .” Airman pondered the question. Admittedly he could have come through either of the walls, they were as decrepit as the ceiling. Airman could never understand The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived 's obsession with using abandoned warehouses as his “secret” lairs. “I should have had a trap ready for you, but you 'd probably just escape instantly, or I could have had a laser ready to vaporize you, or ...” he trailed off. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived slumped into a chair and placed his helmeted head in his hands. “I 'm just not feeling it today man. to tell you the truth I have n't been felling it at all recently. Maybe I should get out of the business .” Airman was horrified. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived was the only active villain in the entire country. Everyone else had either been busted or got out of the game a while ago. If this went on any longer Airman would soon be out of a job. He might even have to go back to, *shudder*, patrolling the streets like a common policeman. “Well do n't do that !” He blurted. Airman had no idea where that came from but he did have the beginnings of an idea forming in the back of his head. The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived looked up. His helmet was cocked at a inquisitive angle. “Do what ?” The idea that had been percolating through Airman 's subconsciousburst into focus. “How would you like it if you could be the Hero of once ?” The words tumbled out of Airman 's mouth almost without him even registering them. Now The Evilest Villain Who Ever Lived really was intrigued. He had always seen himself as the villain, it was all he had ever wanted to be but the last few weeks had shaken that view of himself. “What do you mean ?” he asked “What if I was the villain? What if I could transfer my powers to you, if only of a little while. Would you go back to villainy if we could do that ?” Real Life intercedes! will finish later!"
68,"Twisting around I looked at the landscape in front of me, and at the image currently being reflected on the lake next to me. “When do you think that 's going to happen ?” I asked the Land. “When? It is happening now, and it happened a thousand years ago, it will happen again in five minutes ,” said the Land as if berating a child. I chuckled and moved forward, around me the scene rotated and folded in and around itself. I saw every side of the object held by the men on the battlefield and even inside of them, their very neurons laid bare. It took years for my brain to learn how to interpret the data, and I was lucky. Many of the older humans had been unable to adapt to the fourth dimension and had gone insane. It was understandable, our brains had evolved to handle only 3 dimensions of space. Luckily when the star had collided and forced the Earth into the fourth dimension I had been only about eleven years old, still plenty young enough for the neuroplasticity of my brain to adapt me to the new conditions. Moving through the field I ignored the deluge of information around me, even as I moved through it. I had to, I could see every detail of something in three dimensions much like someone glancing at a piece of paper saw everything on it at once. Most people in this day and age lived within the pockets of 3 dimensional space that remained on Earth, only the wanderers like myself were willing to explore the fourth dimension. We did so at great cost, sanity was the first thing to go for most but past that it was personal attachment to anything. Time inside of the fourth dimension is strange, and although it still linear moves in leaps and bounds while sometimes even freezing in place. Step out of a 3 dimensional space for what felt like an instant and three years or perhaps a second takes place. Their is no way to predict it, but still we Wander. “You are rather introspective at the moment ,” said the Land. The land is something of a collective conciseness, those who go mad in four dimensional space eventually find one another and able to see every nuance of each other eventually merge. The merge also spreads the physicality of the consciousness over all of fourth dimensional space, a false projection of three dimensional space on a 4 dimensional substrate like a projector for a movie. “I 'm thinking that you would do to not look inside my brain .” The Land chuckled, “Why? Most Wanderers welcome a voice to speak to .” I stepped into the water of the lake and through it, the water molecules moved through me unimpeded by my form. “Because most are insane, the people in three dimensional space treat us almost as gods when we enter their realms .” The Land was silent for a moment and a thousand years. “Are you not ?” I chuckled and stepped out of the lake at the edge of another substrate pass-through where fourth and three dimensional space interact. “I am as much a god as you are benevolent .” The Land seemed to consider me but I withstood it 's gaze, it peered into my very mind seeing every neuron connected to every other, observing everything that composed the three dimensional brain operating in four dimensions. “Smart boy .”"
69,"The sand was warm. So was the air, and so was the wind. Everything was comfortably warm and cozy. The body of water - not sure what it was exactly - was sloshing lazily, entrancing me with it 's soft melody. Everything was in the tints of yellow and orange - the setting sun appeared larger than usually, and seemed static for now. I had my sweetheart laying next to me, nuzzling her head in the curve of my neck. She was warm, too, and her touch had a little something special to it. It was not just like touching - it felt almost electric. But not vibrating electric - the touch radiated energetic comfort and security. Everything was quiet except for the water and wind. For once, everything was perfect. It never happened, and it might never happen, but damn it feels good to have a bit of sunshine to go back to sometimes, even though in the end it just makes me feel slightly more miserable when I wake. I have a few more I could describe too. My life was too uneventful to remember a lot of things, but there are a few events that stand out. A few more dreams that have been etched into memories too. Not all of them as nice."
70,"She likes this part of the convent. It was quiet, free from the other sisters. It was easier to meditate here. She had a lot to meditate on. Her life had n't been easy. She was born in a town whose name escaped her to parents who left her in a world where her value was determined by what was between her legs. She had n't minded being a prostitute, not really. It was better than the uglier girls got, working on the streets to sell day old meat and rotten vegetables. Her room in the brothel had the same posters of movie stars that any other teenager her age had had. The only difference had been the constant stream of men- some she admired and some she had hated. The doctor who would tip her an extra ruble was her favorite- he would give her medicine or shots in exchange for favors. Her least favorite was the drunkard- he smelled like a fish and made her do disgusting things. Of course, she had her issues too- the old women who would shake their heads as she walked past them on the streets or the men who would catcall her. She became dissatisfied with her life, with the shame she felt. She happened upon a church one day, and came in because it was quiet. No noises. Nobody looking at her. It was just her and her god there. Her thoughts were interrupted by the large chapel door opening. Her head turned quickly toward the sound, and her eyes met those of an initiate priest. He looked at her, startled, like a rabbit seeing a hawk. “Oh, I 'm sorry, I um ...” “Please, it is fine .” she responded calmly, in her best English. The young man came over to the pew where she was kneeling, and stood next to her for a moment. “Um ... may I ... ?” he asked. She nodded. “My name is Brother Peter .” he introduced himself. “I am Sister Maria .” she looked at him. His hand was outstretched, for what reason she did n't know. His hand wilted after a moment, like a flower after a spring frost. “Your English is very good .” he attempted at conversation. She sighed, realizing that this man would not leave her be. “I learned it here, in the convent. The Mother Superior is a Scot ,” she explained. “Oh. I was born in England .” Peter sat down next to her. “I 'm supposed to be visiting a priest here, to evaluate if I 'm ready to take my vows .” “There are n't any priests in convents, unfortunately for you ,” she looked at him, studying him. He had earnest blue eyes, still wide and hopeful. “Why are you here, Peter ?” she asked. “Um ... I got lost .” he began. “Really lost. I was asking a man here how to find the monastery, but I did n't know the word for it, so I asked him where the house of the faith was. He lead me here. It 's too rainy to go back out on the road, so the Mother Superior said I could stay the night here .” “The mother is a kind woman .” Maria responded. “So what 's your story ?” “My ... story ?” She asked. “Why are you a nun ?” he asked, trying to contain an almost childlike curiosity. “I am a nun because I found God .” she told him. “Your order ... they take the names of saints, right ?” he asked. “Yes, that is true .” “Yours is Maria. Like Maria Gorietti ?” “Yes .” “Um ... the that was ...” his voice dropped to a whisper. “Raped ?” Maria looked away. “Yes .” “... why ?” Maria was taken aback, both by the man 's rudeness, and by the fact he seemed to care. Even in the convent the other sisters judged her for who she was before. Peter did n't seem to be asking her in a mean way, at least she felt. “I was a different woman before I came here. A prostitute .” “Really? Wow .” he studied her for a moment. “I mean, you are very pretty, but I have never heard of a nun that was a prostitute .” “Not many are .” “Is that why you picked Maria as your name? Because of what the men did to you ?” Maria was offended by his nosiness, but for some reason not angry. She felt ... safe? He was n't going to hurt her."
71,"The man sat behind a desk alone before me. He looked at me through tired eyes before speaking. “I have to tell someone. You 're the only one strong enough and trustworthy enough for me to tell. I 'm benevolent to all who come peacefully. I heal their injuries, cure their diseases, help them forget their pain. Those who come to take what I have? They die, and add their power to mine. No one can challenge me, not as I am today. Anyone who would have the power to do so would not risk their own lives with so many others still there to reap. When the Changing happened, the world was plunged into chaos. Those who killed became stronger and unlocked new powers and abilities. These powers came in clusters; one type could summon the elements. Another could augment their strength and speed to superhuman levels. Another could mesmerize and control the minds of the weak. I was a prison guard, a sharpshooter on the watchtowers. It was n't long before the first set of Leveled came for the criminals locked in my facility. Unarmed and locked in cells, the prisoners would be easy prey. But I had my orders - prisoners were to be kept in, and the Leveled kept out. They were weak - no more than level 3 or 4. They died one after the other as my bullets entered their skulls. I gained 5 levels that day. Most really powerful leveled folks were one of the destructive types. Me? I had healing. A little bit of radiant infusion to weapons, quite a bit of increased strength and endurance, but mostly healing. Wounds closed, infections just cleared up. Eventually the prisoners figured out what was going on with the Change and turned on each other, and we had to put them down to prevent them from killing each other and escaping. After the prisoners were gone, the other guards left - either to hide or seek their own strength. I stayed though. I opened the place up to the weak and infirm as a refuge. Became a bit of a leader or father to them. Every time we were assaulted, our foes were captured and brought before me. I served as judge, jury, and executioner. I protect my own, and I do n't brook violence against them. And so I grew stronger. The world has thinned out now - fewer and fewer people. Those who have survived have joined clans and gangs. I heard a rumor that out west someone 's even trying to get a real city-state going. Killing does n't happen much these days. But I just keep Leveling. Lost track of how many times now - hundreds, more than anyone I 've ever heard of. My flock thinks I 'm a gift from God, a holy prophet, their righteous protector. I 'm not about to dispel that notion. My quarters in this prison turned sanctuary are in the old solitary confinement area. No one is allowed back here but me, not since I consigned myself to my plan. You see, after a couple years of Leveling my healing got stronger and stronger. I could cure cancer, bring people back from mortal wounds. Then one day a stranger showed up. He was off in the head, would n't let me examine or try to heal him. That night he killed an old lady and the next morning we did what we had to. I put a bullet in his head and his light went out forever. I felt the now-familiar surge of power as I leveled up yet again. But this time it was a little different. I felt a compulsion ... I walked up to the corpse of the man I 'd just killed and laid my hand on his chest. Power surged through me and light surrounded me and the killer opened his eyes. *Resurrection*. I 'd raised him from the dead. I let someone else put him down after that. I retreated to my quarters, mind reeling. I felt a sense of honor and duty to my flock, but this gift ... this new gift was amazing! What could I do with it? It was then that I knew how I would proceed. No one 's left to challenge me. But I keep getting stronger. No one sees me kill new victims - I even stepped down as executioner, allowing those I trust to take the lives that need to be taken. That 's why you 're my executioner, and you 're the most powerful one in this place save myself. No one knows how I keep getting stronger and stronger. But I do. And now it 's time once again .” The man, my leader, my prophet stood from his desk and walked to the walls. He pressed a button and a buzzer sounded throughout the solitary confinement area. 20 doors opened and the faint smell of death wafted out. The bodies were tied to chairs securely, their mouths gagged and their throats slit. Layer upon layer of dried blood covered their bindings, laps and the floor around them. White light surrounded him as he raised his hands"
72,"There was a small summerhouse my grandfather owned ... a farm that we called our “dacha .” Most officials had a dacha, usually a simple retreat or a cottage at the outskirts of the major cities, deep into their private hunting grounds. But my grandfather, in his Western cowboy hat and a torso so often exposed that it was burnt to a hide -- he was a man who felt it necessary to work on his time off. And with the collapse of the Union, he had a lot of time off while reformations were underway. We were n't usually around enough for us to keep any livestock, so instead we planted mostly vegetables. Beets and turnips, radishes and potatoes. We had an entire section just for poppies. Fresh poppy seeds were something you could n't find anywhere else -- though my brother often warned me that I should n't eat too many, or else I 'll fall asleep forever. There was a pond beside our home and a large river within a mile 's walk in either end of the surrounding forests, so we could just gather wild river berries and hunt for fish near their banks. My brother was the one who taught me how to fish. To cut the worms in half so we have twice as many, to poke them through deep enough on the hooks so they would n't wriggle off in the water. I watched as he took his small Swiss knife and pressed it through the worm, both ends dancing feverishly, absolutely silent, in the dirt. “It does n't hurt ?” “They do n't feel anything ?” “But he looks like he 's in pain .” “It 's a worm. Do you hear him screaming? No. He does n't feel anything .” Somehow, I could never do it myself without thinking about it. I 'd turn my eyes away and just press as hard as I could until I felt the texture change, the blade cut it 's way clean through the worm. I 've wondered if my brother ever had the same thoughts. The same aversions. But he did n't seem phased. Cut. Poke. Fish. It was just ritual to him. A process. He reminded much of our grandfather in that way. Quite. Meticulous. Somehow it seemed so natural, the way he could skin a rabbit or butcher a chicken. I always felt there was something broken in me, not being able to match their standard. I always had to suspend myself, to go blank in the head and close my eyes, just cutting up worms for bait. The two of them tended to the farm, mostly. I only watered and spread out the manure. When I was finally old enough, my grandfather gave me my own apple tree, which grew beautifully for about three months. Just when it was tall enough to warrant some supports, it just stopped growing. “Did you water your tree ?” My grandfather scolded me. “Of course !” I pleaded. “I water it every day! I even gave it extra compost! I do n't know why it wo n't grow .” He clicked his teeth and shook his head back and forth at my sad little tree. “Trees do n't just stop growing, Yozhik .” He smacked the back of my head, just enough for the crack of pain to connect through. “I could have planted this in the woods and it would have grown on it 's own !” “I 'm sorry ,” I said, but I was n't sure if he even heard my whimper. “Go catch some fish, at least .” His voice was dry, but the undertone of disappointment was obvious. “Hopefully you can handle holding a stick over water .” I nodded and ran into the house. “Lyosha” I called. “We need to go fishing !” The farm was strangely positioned against the sun, so the only time it was properly lit up was when the sun was setting. There were no windows on the front end of the house, only the back, where my brother was sitting now. His hands buried, busily working, inside a burlap potato sack. The pain hit me again, but this time his smack was more sincere. “I said *you* !” Do not bother your brother with this. Lyosha looked up at me, his face serious. His eyes shone like a cat in the dark, just the light of the doorway behind me lighting up his corner. “But ... that 's the woods .” I said. “What if there 's a wolf ?” “You have a knife .” He put his hand on my back and ushered me back out the door. “My little knife ca n't kill a wolf! I 'm not stro ...” My grandfather looked down at me. I could tell his face was in anticipation of my next word"
73,"I came here thinking it was gods county, yeah . They welcomed me at first, got to known their names their hobbies, their families and friends. I felt accepted. Then a switch triggered, some said it did n't matter what those other people did. But they never did look me in the eyes like before. I was. Fine being an outcast. A could get by with my job and my work. But they could never let it rest. I was a foreign virus to them. So I gave them something back. Showed them I would n't take it. I became what they thought I was. But even more terrifying. They wanted a villian, might as well give them the devil'"
74,"I told Dani it was because of the surgery, and I suppose I wasn’t really lying. It was a perfectly natural response when faced with your own mortality to rethink your life, and the choices you’ve made, right? I hated to hurt her like that, we’d been perfectly happy for god knows how long. I *loved* her, but after the transplant… Explaining this to the empty bottle in my hand was a little easier than explaining to Dani, it didn’t look back at me with big brown tear-filled eyes. Still, they both reminded me that I was totally alone. *Fuck. * Why did I do this to myself? I should have waited a few more months, I should have tried harder! Why did I suddenly change? It wasn’t Dani, that was for sure, she was such a constant person. I was *positive* the change happened after the surgery. It was like a light switch turning off, the moment I woke up after the transplant, I had fallen out of love. That was that. I should get outta here. Garret was letting me sleep at his place and I didn’t want to piss him off and show up drunk in the middle of the night. I probably shouldn’t be drinking at all, but if I was gunna be voluntarily destroying my life I might as well be thorough. I turned right out of habit when I left the bar, but spun right back around at the end of the block. That way was Dani’s place, not mine. Garret lived uptown so I’d have to take the bus. Checking the time on my phone, I realized the next bus wouldn’t be here for another 20 minutes, so I sat down on the bench to wait. I put my face in my hands so I could better stew in my own misery, but a soft voice startled me out of my moping, causing my heart to thump erratically. “Are you alright? ” I hadn’t even seen her there. Her dark coat blended into the night, but I realized now that she’d been waiting here since before I’d arrived. She was tiny, and obviously not a threat; I tried to calm down and slow my racing pulse. “O-oh. Eh, not really.” I answered her honestly. I just couldn’t make myself respond with the customary “fine.” She surprised me again by giving me a look of understanding, rather than one of polite concern. It seemed like she really *was* interested in my problems. “Would you like to talk about it? The bus won’t be here for a while. It might help.” She replied gently, scooting a bit closer to me on the bench. What a strangely compassionate person. I looked her in the eye for a moment, they were a bright blue, and nothing like Dani’s. Ah, *Dani. * I signed and turned away. “No, no that’s ok. I don’t need to bother you with how I’m ruining my life, ” I sighed, putting my face back in my hands. She gave a soft laugh, at that. “Take this from an outside observer: It’s tough now, but you’ll be alright in the end. As long as you still have a life, there’s hope for a future.” I peaked between my fingers at her, she met my gaze with a serious expression on her face. “Has anyone died? ” she scolded me. “... no…” I answered slowly. “Then there’s still hope.” she countered with real fierceness. I didn’t know what to say to that, she was starting to take this personally. I just stared back blankly. She hesitated for a moment, clearly embarrassed by her outburst, and ducked her head to allow her soft brown hair to obscure her face. Now I felt like it was my turn to comfort her. “A-are *you* alright? ” She looked up at me after a long moment, a small frown on her lips. Her eyes shone but she didn’t let her tears fall. “No, ” she answered evenly. “My husband died a couple months ago. When I saw you here, you-you reminded me of him.” She sighed. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have-” “No-no-no, it’s okay, ” I reassured her. “Um, how did he die, if you don’t mind telling me about it? ” I could feel my pulse quicken in anxiety. I wasn’t great at talking about this kind of stuff, especially with a stranger, but I didn’t have much of a choice. “Motorcycle accident.” She said simply. “One day he was perfectly fine"
75,"I saw you curled in a cotton- soft maple-red sweater arms stretched and resting between your knees. Across the table I saw your teeth shine in smiles and your train-track thump-thump-thump of a laugh, lighter and more dove-like than the calls of the doves themselves. You lean in close — our eyes almost kissing — and then pull back out to sip your tea and laugh, laugh, laugh again. Your legs cross, uncross; your gaze, caught between my own and the finger of heat smoke rising from the tea, and your hands clasping, unclasping, stroking each digit in the same wanting motion. I saw you watching, in turn my eyes, lips, hands, feet, my flush — to match the too-bright light waxing and waning against your vacuum iris — folding against the edges of space — do you feel it too? — this black hole between us, sucking us, dragging us gasping and panting, lovingly into this new, pregnant darkness."
76,"She was ticked off, again. They knew it was a problem with her. She could n't help it. She 'd been raised to finish what she started. But they constantly scheduled her for just start of these long flights. But she had an ace in the hole, this time. She 'd gotten her certifications, and she was commander on all her flights from now on. Whenever she had two more takeoffs than landings, she began to feel anxiety. The feeling that she was n't coming back this time because she 'd left something undone. Like forgetting to put up the landing gear, or raise the flaps after takeoff. Well, if she had taken off but had n't landed the damn plane at all, she had left something undone. Naturally that causes anxiety. But as commander, she could take the yoke herself, anytime she wanted. Just to be sure, she told herself, she would make a point of landing 20 of 30 more times in the next year than she took off. And no more anxieties about being two landings down."
77,"The frayed rope was starting to make me itch, but I knew that I could n't move. I start to feel weak from the hunger, “Come on girl you 've gone hours longer than this .” Whoa was that a stick cracking? I better play dead now. “H-hey, a-are you okay ?” “H-hello ?” “Hey this knife is so I can help you to get you down. Okay ?” “The blood is from a coyote that attacked me earlier, but I got away .” “Damn it, sorry I wo n't slip anymore, I promise, this is my first time seeing an already dead body .” “But you 're different maybe we can be friends .” Ha, this lady is crazy, but no matter, her body will be swinging on my fan with the other two bodies. I wonder if they 're still alive. “Okay, it might hurt when you fall down, sorry .” “Do n't worry though, I 'll make sure to clean you up real good .” “Now you wait here and do n't move while I go get a friend of mine. He 's just on the other side of this bend .” Ok, this is my chance to get her. Maybe I 'll wait for her friend that way I can replace the weird guy who 's starting to smell up the room. Oh there she i ... wait is she dragging a dead man? “Hey sorry for taking so long, but this guy is heavier than I thought, and he does n't feel like walking now .” “But maybe you 'll want to walk so I do n't have to drag you both .” “hey wait a minute did you just move ?” “You were n't supposed to move” “YES I MOVED, you stupid crazy lady, but since your 'friend here is already dead I 'll have to take just you .” “Now I 'm going to pick up this rock and only knock you unconscious .” Damn this rock is heavier than I thought. “Um, no I think you got it wrong, I 'm going to pick up this big stick and kill you with it .” “And do n't bother screaming since there is n't anyone around for miles and miles .” This lady must be stupid to try to kill me, I 've been doing this for almost two years, “Hey, you know what, I was going to be nice to you, but since you threatened me, I 'm going to knock you unconscious, then I 'm going to drag you to my house, and I 'm going to hang a knife next to you on the fan. The knife will stab into you every time I turn on the fan, and it will come out when I turn off the fan .” Damn this is such a good idea, I 'll start doing this from now on. “Oh yeah, you 're going to have to hit me first, but as you can see my stick is bigger than your rock, I do n't know how you plan on knocking me out but I can assure you that I will kill before you can even get close .” Damn it she 's right “Fine, look you 've already got a friend and since he looks kind of heavy, why do n't I help you get him to your car and then we go our separate ways, okay ?” “What so then you can kill me while loading the body into my car” I do n't think so .” Damn it this lady is smarter than I thought “No I promise I wo n't kill you while loading up your car, In fact I have a better chance of being killed by you .” This stupid lady better just let me 'help her'before I get mad. “Fine, you help me and I wo n't kill you, but you need to promise not to follow my car to my house .” “Okay, I wo n't follow your car .” Now can you put the stick down and I 'll take his legs while you take his arms and we 'll lift him up .” “Okay. We have to go back the way I came in because it 's shorter than going around the whole loop .” “Okay, let 's just go .” Wow does this lady think I 'm stupid or something? I 'll show her who 's the dumb one really is. -- -- -- -- - 2 hours later -- -- -- -- - “Okay my car is the silver mini van .” “Well obviously that 's your car, it 's the only one here besides my car .” Wow this lady is stupider than I thought, maybe she is why we have the 'dumb blonde'stereotype. Oh well I 'll help her and then I 'm going to just leave and kill two people tomorrow. “Hey we need to set him down so I can get"
78,"Duane emerged from his parent 's basement on day 12 of the apocalypse, his neckbeard bristling. He had spent the last fortnight huddled in the cellar with all of his gear at the ready. He urged his parents to do the same, but the fools had shrugged off his warnings and had met their fate the previous day. They shouted through the basement door that they were n't feeling well and were going to try going to a hospital or a government medical camp that had been set up nearby. Their corpses were not upstairs, and Duane assumed they were now roaming the streets with the rest of the undead. Duane had studied the holy scriptures and prophecies for years. Everything from 'Dawn of the Dead'to 'The Walking Dead'and everything in between. He had played the training simulation series 'Left 4 Dead'so much it was now second nature. And when Duane had first heard reports of the spread of the sickness a fortnight ago, he had initiated phase 1 of the survival process, buying ammunition, Doritos and Monster Energy Drink in bulk, then barricading himself in the basement. But now Duane had reached the fun part of survival: Killing Zombies! Duane was clad in his favorite black trenchcoat covering his camouflage cargo shorts and 'My Little Pony't-shirt. His feathered fedora perched atop his usual long ponytail. A black, tacticool, 12-Gauge shotgun, complete with a holographic sight, flashlight and bayonet attachment was slung across his shoulders. His sidearm, a Desert Eagle, chambered in .50 caliber Action Express and loaded with jacketed hollow point ammunition, was strapped to his chest holster, it sported a laser sight and was also painted tacticool-black. In his backpack, he had a week 's supply worth of beef jerky and Monster Energy Drink as well as several hundred rounds of extra ammo. But the most attention grabbing piece of Duane 's getup was the large Katana in his hand, his most prized possession. Duane had saved up a month 's worth of pay from his job at the local Hibachi grill before he could afford to buy the 'genuine'Masamune replica from the sword shop at the local shopping mall. Duane entered the street in front of his parents house to find it deserted, as expected. The power had been out for a week and he had been unable to pick up any radio channels on his emergency radio for the last week. He set a steady pace towards the shopping mall, hoping that survivors had found safety in the defensible structure. A half hour into his trek, he had to stop and rest against an abandoned car. It had been years since he had walked this far in one go. He had another thirty minutes before he would near the shopping mall. Once again, he struck off, intent to reach the mall before sundown. Anther fifteen minutes passed and Duane saw a figure on the horizon, Duane could tell by their even gait that this was a human and not a zombie. “Fuck, I 'm tired. I 'll just wait here .” Duane mumbled aloud. He unholstered the Desert Eagle and switched on the laser sight. Duane watched as a man approached him, his footfalls growing slower and slower as he approached. “Greetings gentlesir !” Duane called out. “Uh ... hi .” The man slowed to a stop, about twenty feet from Duane, looking suspicious. “Have you seen any zombies ?” Duane asked. “... any what ?” The man said, eyes darting between the giant pistol in Duane 's right hand and the Katana in his left. “Zom-Bies ...” Duane enunciated. “... Zombies ?” The man asked. Duane gaped at the man dumbfounded. How had this fool managed to survive for 12 whole days? He was n't even carrying any weapons or survival gear. “Zombies! You know, the walking dead? I 've been in my bunker the last few days, so I do n't know what you all are calling them up here .” The man just stared at him. Duane suspected the man was playing stupid and that this was a trick of some kind, so he broke into a half-sprint, running past the man and continuing towards the mall. It was n't long before he encountered another person, but finally, Duane felt his destiny as a Zombie Hunter was about to take off: this person was wearing a HazMat suit and would likely be knowledgeable about Zombies. He stopped short about 15 feet from the HazMat worker before doubling over to catch his breath. “Sir! Are you okay? !? !” The HazMat worker asked. Duane held up his index finger as if to say, 'just a sec, 'and continued panting heavily. Finally, his breath caught, he righted himself and faced the HazMat worker. He could see through the transparent mask that the HazMat worker was, in fact, an attractive female. “Sweet !” Duane thought to himself. “This"
79,"In an quiet throne room made of old stone and dressed in fresh blood, Casper and the Gray Emperor regarded one another with weary resignation. “In the end ,” said the Gray Emperor, groaning as he lowered his weight down to the simple, steel throne, “I could n't save anyone. And perhaps I never should have tried .” “*Saved* ?” The word was bitter and bile in Casper 's mouth. “Have you any idea of the lives you 've taken? The blood you 've spilled ?” “Yes, yes, of course .” The Emperor swept a thin hand down across the dais. “There. Penbrook. My most honorable man-at-arms. He was a smithy when I met him, if you can believe that. A good one, as well. A good *man*. Four children. Beautiful, courageous Eileen back home. He loved darts. Had no taste for gambling. Painted. Worried about my health. Worried about this kingdom. A good man .” The Emperor nodded. “Dead. All of them, dead. My men. *Your* men. Your horse - a beautiful horse, I should add. And brave. I saw the way it leapt across the fiery moat. No other horse would do such a thing .” “Dead defending you ,” said Casper, cold, barely above a whisper. “Dead trying to *kill* you. Dead because of you and the horrors you have unleashed upon this land .” “Certainly ,” said the Emperor. “And I do n't suppose you could be convinced to allow me to continue as I was, eh ?” Casper laughed, nearly weeping with exhaustion and spoiled anxiety. “I never would have guessed you 'd have a sense of humor .” He drew a deep breath and leveled his sword. “But I guess I do n't have much room in my heart for laughter these days .” The Emperor smiled, careful eyes never leaving Casper 's face. “I would n't go so far as to say that the things I 've done have been justified, but it seems it would serve us both to understand what 's at stake .” “Your death ,” said Casper mildly, advancing on the older man. “That is the only thing left on the table. Your reign of terror ends today .” “I 've seen the world - what it becomes ,” said the Emperor hastily, drawing back in his chair. “I 've seen the future. I see it every night when I close my eyes .” “I 'm not concerned with the future ,” said Casper. “Everyone I 've ever loved is dead. My home is half in ruin. What do your nightmares mean to me ?” “The *world* ,” said the Gray Emperor, clutching at the arms of his throne. “You have no idea what it wants to become. No matter what hell you think I 've made here on Earth, you must believe me when I tell how much *worse* it threatens to become .” “Worse than murder ?” said Casper. “Villages burned to the ground? Bloodlines *erased*? Worse than that ?” The Emperor sighed. “I do n't suppose I would ever be able to convince you, but the things I have seen ... they are haunting in ways you could not imagine. What human beings become ... what they do to one another ...” “I have seen the worst of what a human may do .” “Then imagine *demons* !” shouted the Emperor. “Imagine wraiths! Imagine soulless abominations. Feeling nothing. Being nothing. Simply consuming. Ravaging. Anything and everything. Until there is nothing. Because *that* is what I see. *That* is what man strives to make of himself. “I am not a godly man and I do not consider my works holy in any way, but know that the evil I do, I do for the better sake of all mankind. It is a protection. A benediction. I am the evil of the world. I give men like you focus. Hunger. Ambition. I am the lone demon in the dark. And when I am gone, there will be no evil but the evil inside your hearts. The world will be overrun with apathy. No one will be spared .” The Emperor took a slow, steadying breath. Casper watched the old man sweat and shake. “What you describe sounds like freedom ,” said Casper after some time. “It is Hell ,” said the Emperor. “And what if it was just a bad dream ?” The Emperor considered this for some time. “Then I suppose this must be part of the dream, because what torment could be worse than to have done what I 've done ... and been wrong ?” Casper placed the tip of his sword under the Emperor 's neck. “Should I wake you ?”"
80,"I 've waited 15 years for this very day. Today, I start my teaching job at my old elementary school. Whenever I told anyone my reasons for coming back they would always laugh and call me crazy, even my closest friends. But today, I 'll prove them wrong. Today, I will finally see what 's actually on the mythical, “Fourth Floor”. There had always been rumors circulating about it, I even overheard two 3rd graders talking about earlier. Back when I went here, everyone believed there used to be a swimming pool up there, but after a younger student drowned they decided to close it, and now his ghost haunts the school. My older brother claimed that the teachers slept up there, in strange, coffin like beds. All I know is that there 's something there, something that needs to be kept hidden. Now, I would finally be able to solve the mystery for myself. I stood in front of the tall, ominous door that led to the 4th floor. It was a heavy steel door, something that belonged in a high security prison, not an elementary school. The door made a heavy thud as I unlocked it, and slowly, I pushed it open. A gust of cold, heavy air flowed out of the room, followed by the distinct smell of old books. I flicked on the light switch and the florescent lights lit up one by one. I could n't believe my own eyes, on the fourth floor there was n't a swimming pool or coffins, but rows upon rows of file cabinets stacked up to the ceiling. There was only one thing that this could be. On the fourth floor of my elementary school, permanent records were stored. At first I doubted it, there was no way such a place could exist. But after a little searching I had found my name. It had everything in it, there was a write up about the time I had shot chocolate milk out of my nose at my teacher, it had all of my old tests, all of my projects, everything. Everything I had done was carefully recorded and preserved, and locked away for the ages. Do what you want with this information, you can choose to believe it or not to, I honestly do n't know If I believe it myself. I do n't know if there 's something like this at every school, but I do know there is something. The secret basement, the hidden door, the fourth floor. Every school has its legends, its up to you to find the truth."
81,"**Lesson 1: Fire does n't care** Fire does n't have an objective. It does n't have a strategy or a plan. It does n't even hate you, Fire does n't have feelings. Fire burns to make more fire, like a plague makes more and more people sick. A plague does n't care about who or why, it just cares that it is spreading. Fire is a plague. **Lesson 2: Fire can be hurt** Fire is too simple to know it, but it can be hurt all the same. Kick at it 's heart, and snuff out it 's very essence. Use your boots, when you can, keep your face away from the flames. Use your hands, if you have to, it is better than letting fire spread wildly. Use your body, if you must. To protect those whom we are sworn to rescue. To protect our brothers in arms. **Lesson 3: Rely on your brothers. Rely on yourself** -- - Those were the only three lessons that were given to us, before we were sent into a conflagration. There was also a lot of physical training, certainly, to the point that I could accurately throw a flying kick to any surface from shoulder level down. I could even use my gloved hands with such speed and accuracy that the flames never seemed to touch them. Of course, the training grounds were nothing like the field. In the field ... strange things happened. In the field, Fire is more alive. It is not like the captive fire that we create and promptly snuff out in our barracks. It is not even like the careful, tentative fire that we fought on our graduation exam. In the field, Fire is more primal, more raw ... more violent. It pretends to be snuffed, only to bounce back a moment later. In training they told us never to turn our back to Fire. In the field, we learned just how hard it is to follow that maxim. But we fight on. We fight on because there is no hiding from Fire, not if we let it grow. We fight on because we are the only wall to protect our families from this inferno. We fight on, because there is no better choice. Once upon a time, I heard, they used water to douse the flames. Water, such a precious gift, wasted so recklessly. We fight on, with parched throats and dry eyes, because only after a successful day in the field will we be given our water rations to share with our loved ones. Meagre as they are, we fight on because to stop would be to die."
82,"I 've enjoyed writing since I was a small child, to be honest. I have vague memories of having to write and illustrate a story about a duck in like 2nd or 3rd grade, and I think that is what got me started. It was n't until about 9th grade that I got any good at it, to be honest. Since then, I 've been writing random poetry and short stories when the mood strikes me. I keep writing because, like many others, it 's a way to escape myself for awhile in a productive fashion. I 've always been a daydreamer, writing just lets me put a lot of those daydreams down on paper. I get ideas or I need to vent emotions, and I get an image in my head of a scene that I just need to express in words, so I open up the laptop or grab a piece of paper and I start writing."
83,"Hi Lucy. You don’t know me, but in ten years we’ll know each other very well. I’m sure that you’ll dismiss this letter as the ramblings of a mad woman, but I hope you remember some of it when we finally meet. My name’s Josie, and I am your soulmate. I know, I sound crazy, but it’s true. In ten years we’ll meet and everything will be wonderful, but until then I am counting the days. I hope this letter finds you well. I hope you are happy with where you are in life, and I hope you read this letter soon. I know it’s cryptic, but it will all make sense. I’m not really sure what to say, so I’ll leave it here. Don’t try and find me before our time. Love, Josie. P.S – If you didn’t know you liked women, Surprise?"
84,"Dear Dirary, Apparently I 'm a god now. But before being a god, I was just an adventurer. I guess that 's what I 'd call it? I 'd go on adventures. Me, some friends, solving problems and slaying monsters. It was pretty fun, not extremely rewarding but job prospects are n't exactly great in my village. Just various shades of merchant - Oh, and one bartender. Anyway, I went on a particular adventure not long ago and things got pretty hectic. Our group was pretty tight though, we handled things well given the circumstances. We had Tess, my childhood friend and our white magic user; Edwin, this total dick from the village who just happens to be amazing with a spear; Slops, a wise, respected old knight who for some reason stuck with the nickname “Slops”; and Ren, a mysterious, extremely powerful Elf mage, reformed villain and all-round great guy. We also had this Lycan with us, Rex. He was cool but at some point he got turned into an *actual* wolf and sort of wandered off in the woods. To cut a long story short: We were tracking a big bad guy hellbent on world annihilation, and for some reason we were the only people trying to stop that from happening. Not sure why. Along the way, we burned down an evil, living castle; hung out with some ghosts; discovered an underwater cult which we also, somehow, burned down; and a bunch of other stuff. Ren actually revealed he was working for the big bad at one point and he killed Slops. Well, the heart attack killed Slops. We were all pretty shocked because Ren is just an awesome guy. He totally came back and saved us near the end though, which was great. Shame about Slops. The world actually got destroyed in some way, like three times. But we fixed it, somehow - I do n't know the specifics. Magic stuff. Ren 's the guy to ask if you want the know-how. At some point during the final, world-saving battle I was legally dead for about 12 minutes. I had a run in with some entity that rules the cosmos, and he declared me a god. I think that sort of spurred me on to kill the evil villain in the end, to be fair. Anyway, that was yesterday. I just sort of slept on it. It does n't feel much different being a god, to be honest with you. Not sure what I 'm supposed to be doing. I 've tried answering prayers, but I was n't hearing any of them. I also ca n't shoot fireballs - I think. I tried smiting the shit out of Edwin, but I 'm not sure if it worked. He 's such a dick. I 'm gon na meet Ren in a bit ... Just to, y'know, hang out. Maybe he knows a bit about this god stuff because he knows a lot of things. Such a cool guy. I might see what Tess is up to, but she 's probably with Edwin and he 'll cramp mine and Ren 's style. What a dick. So, Diary, that was my week. Sorry I did n't write for a while - I was saving the world! Hehe. I 'll update when I 've figured out this godhood business. I honestly have no idea what I 'm doing. Bye!"

86,"My lovely wife, she is a witch. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, she just born that way. The first witch from a muggle family. I still remember the day she brought me to this Diagon Alley, I could not believe nor understand two thirds of what was going on, she laugh and laugh at my dropped jaw and pushed me inside this toy store on a corner. There a red hair man was telling a joke and kids around him where clapping. “That 's George Weasley ,” she said, “I told you about him already .” and she had, that secret war that run about 20 years ago, she was a little kid back then not even having received her acceptance letter. But now she was a witch, a proper witch, and I am her husband, which is nice, do n't get me wrong, but its so weird. Specially at the store. I bought the store 3 years ago, as I 'm a veterinarian I though I could do it, I mean, I just have to sell kids pets, how complicated could that be? oh ... boy ... you have no idea. I do n't know why, but beast behave different around wizardry people, I employ a kid that just got out of “hag warts”! he, if Amanda hears it she 'll kill me, anyway, this kid can talk to spiders and they do whatever he wants, I have to be wary of him asking them to build nets in the door frames and not eat them every time i go by, but I could not expect less of a Weasley I guess. And then the frogs, did you know you can buy a potion that will send frogs to sleep? and that you can buy them by barrel because they wont stop singing if you do n't? I did n't knew I have been working on fixing a dog 's bad teeth and then having a pixie wanting to steel it from me, that was fun. Or when the house elfs came by and ordered and cleaned the store, what 's with that, they didn’t even asked for anything and where just happy and chapping all the time, I almost shat my pants the first time. Just the other day there was an old woman who wanted me to find her a vulture bird because she needed a hunting companion ... luckily my lovely wife told her that that was illegal both on the muggle and the wizardry worlds. But what weird me the most are all those cages my wife and our employee handle all day, those that seem to have nothing inside, they give me the chills. Luckily I’ve made some friends with the locals, specially this incredible huge guy who hangs at the bar frequently, he is always interested on hearing me talk about normal everyday animals, and then he talks and talks about things i can hardly believe, dragons and mermaids, nargles and hypogriphs. I love my wife and the world she lives in, and i love that i can see at least part of it, but some nights i ca n't sleep thinking about those empty cages, and what if my wife and myself are not seeing even weirder things out there. =========== I 'm not good at English: ("
87,"I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I 've done in life can not be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it 's the business I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I 'm 52 now -- probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there 's one thing I do n't regret and it 's taking the life of a criminal who did n't belong. I hunt evil people who 've caused misery to communities and I believe I 've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a .357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I did n't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell."
88,"It was always the arms first, then legs, then more gruesome adventurers toyed with the body while others would just get it over with. This was the third body this week, hundred twenty-first this month ( something about vacations tended to up the number ), and an uncountable number each year. “Glad we could haggle on this piece, let 's do it again some time ,” the ruddy looking thief gloated as he ripped the gold chain off its stand and cheerily walked out of the shop. It used to be I would stare daggers at them after they did this. It also used to be that I mourned the loss of inventory, pride, and body parts. But now, now this was a perfect system. Adventurer comes in, if they 're assholes they kill me, steal things, then fence it for a tenth the price and it “miraculously” shows back up in my storehouse for another greedy fool to try again the next day. The biggest problem, of course, was the back-alley magic fees to maintain the facade, but I could live with it so long as the process did n't have any hitches. Two hours later I 'd finally polished the blood off the back mantle when I heard the chime at the front. “Hello ?” the soft spoken greeting was surprising for this side of town. More oddly, it accompanied a strange and sickening gurgling and scraping with each step across the floor, followed by the more usual clinking, squishing, and sloshing. Rounding the front shelves, a young, slight, almost pallid woman appeared in view. “Are you the shopkeep ?” “Why yes, Vlorium, just like the sign says. What can I do for you today ?” As I introduced myself, I calmly tossed the bloody rag into a bucket underneath the display. Sometimes that impressed adventurers not to waste my time ... sometimes. “Well ,” she said dragging an absolutely massive bag into view, “I think I might have some things to trade .” The streak of blood and bile leaking from the bottom did n't phase me so much as its color. Jet black fluid with orange bubbles slowly rising and spotting its surface. I swallowed just a bit. “My brother was here a few weeks ago and said this was the best shop for an ID .” She shifted the bag further into view and uncinched its tie, spilling out a half-hundred trinkets, weapons, and jarred organs. “I just got my wizarding license last week and, my god, it 's amazing what you can find out in the world! I do n't have half a clue what all of this, would you mind helping me ?” I still could n't see to the bottom of the bag, but despite my apprehension I forced a smile and pointed back at a list board, “Yes of course, happy to do that, standard fee of course .” “Why yes! Here it is ,” she pulled a small sack of coins from her waste and counted out the fee. Staring at the growing stack of cash on the counter, a small voice started up in my head. “You seem pretty sharp, most folks can barely recognize an granat, much less count the pennies to it .” She smiled sheepishly, “well, I heard you did n't like to wait on such things, so I may have counted it out ahead of time .” I arched an eyebrow, “who did you say your brother was again ?” She waved it off, “Oh, he 's just simple rogue, no one of consequence. He just liked your efficiency, that 's all .” The little voice grew louder, I could taste the slightest touch of bile, but I pushed it down. “Your name then ?” She looked up quickly, still measuring stacks of coin by touch, “Anessa, lovely to meet you .” With a curt nod she indicated she was finished. Quickly looking through the piles, it seemed like enough for whatever she may have brought, and I stepped from behind the counter, “Let 's see what you have there. Well, right off the bat I can say that those daggers are n't half-bad, Xvisish if I know the make, and quality at that. Typical market value is at least 20 granats a piece, or for a matched pair a full 100. That bauble over there, that 's a Litrigan tusk ring ... a lower tusk ring. Hope you had gloves on when you picked that up .” That received a shudder from her, and an unconscious hand wipe on her tunic, “yes ... yes ... the smell alone ... I threw away the gloves afterwards .” I chuckled, “Sadly that was actually a bad idea, that 's what makes the Litrigan valuable. God knows why, but some old wives tale has a tea of it. I feel more sorry for the alchemists guild, they have to brew the damn stuff .” There was a slight gagging noise behind me, but I ignored it and kept sifting through the pile, pointing out valuables and items that"
89,"He looked out from the veranda, now his veranda, with a shameful, sinking pride, the sort of pride that could turn a man into the very monster he had just defeated. He leaned on the railing and let out a heavy sigh. Abraham, the oldest slave on the lot, hobbled over and clasped his hand over Homer 's, looking through him. The weight of his gleaming gaze forced Homer to meet his eyes. Abraham drew in deeply, as though he were about to speak, his brow furrowing over his powerful eyes, which were circumscribed with wrinkles. He exhaled deeply and quickly, an unsatisfying response. Homer could not detect the sentiment buried under the man 's expressions. “What would you have had me do? They killed her .” He slumped down on the railing further and began to quiver, despite the hot Alabama sun that stared overhead. Anguished cries lept muffled from the hotbox in the yard and lingered in the heavy air, droning on like a mosquito. “I pass no judgement ,” Abraham said lowly. “Today is something you will think about every other day, for the rest of your life, whether good or bad. I have no right to interfere further .” Homer let out an involuntary laugh, “You have every right. Your life is no longer what it was. Soon they will figure it out. Word will reach town, and then what? Me, I 'll try to find my daughter. It 's what she would have done .” He paused, waiting for a response that would indicate any sense of future for the old man. “Son, I 'm not going anywhere ,” Abraham replied, stepping back from the porch to ease himself into the cushioned rocker, “You know as well as I do there 's no place to go. Not for me .” He tipped his fraying straw hat and took a sip from the sweating glass on the table beside him. The sound of hoof beats pounded in the distance. “Well, I guess that 's that, then ,” Abraham quietly observed. “You 'd better be on your way, now .” Homer twisted the wood beneath his hand in desperate frustration. His heart overtook the hoof beats, and blood pounded in his ear. He knew he was right. Homer bent down and grabbed his bag, throwing it over his shoulder and indulged for one last time."
90,"Once upon a time, in a little village called Portempo, there lived a little boy named Jim-Jam. Jim-Jam lived an ordinary life in the village. Like most people, he walked the cobblestone streets, no longer under threat of dragon attack. Jim-Jam stopped and took a seat next to the the Jar-Jam memorial statue which sits in the main square. “One goal, one gift, one future. - General Jar-Jam ( dragon defense division )” The dedication plaque gleamed brightly in the midday sun. A reminder of the sacrifice made by the elders just 10 years ago. From his pocket satchel, Jim-Jam pulled out a dragon roast sandwich and took an ambitious bite. He chewed voraciously as he watched the lives of his bustling village play out. There was Jay-Jam, the village spiritual leader. Originally from a town about 10 days on foot, Jay-Jam fled with as many survivors as he could gather when the mountain clans forced their way through the uninhabitable zone and claimed his village for their own. Jay-Jam waved at passersby as his children, adoptive orphans of war, passed out leaflets announcing the upcoming worship festival. Having finished his sandwich, Jim-Jam took a sip of pumpkin ale. An orphan of war himself, Jim-Jam has taken to hanging around the blacksmith 's shook. Jak-Jam made the finest weapons and mining carts this side of the Tempo river and is expecting Jim-Jam to deliver a very important package, a very common job for orphans of war to take on. As he approached Jak-Jam shop a little boy, younger than Jim-Jam stopped him to say hello. It was Joi-Jam, a classmate of his who enjoys reading huge books and conducting science experiments for fun. With courteousness being a core value of Portempo, Jim-Jam patiently conversed as Joi-Jam rambled on about the progress Professor Jet-Jam was making with his attempt to create a cure for the Jug-Jam Virus, named after Doctor Jug-Jam who first discovered the potential lethality of the previously unknown pathogen which claimed hundreds of Miners'lives. Politely excusing himself, Jim-Jam eventually made his way into the blacksmith 's shop and greeted Jak-Jam as he handed the parcel over. Jak-Jam smiled and thanked the boy, handing him a small sack of coins for his efforts. Jim-Jam jingled as he made his way home. The setting sun cast a pink glow over the calming village while Jim-Jam stoked the fire keeping his mudhut warm as the chill of the night air crept into Portempo. As Jim-Jam laid his head to rest, his mind started wandering through the possibilities the future might hold. Thoughts of joining the Village Defense Militia for glory, or being a famous Jez-Jez player traveling around playing against the teams from each of the 10 Kingdoms, but these are just the dreams of war orphans. Soon, Jim-Jam will blink his eyes in the new morning sun, waking up to a new day in the village of Portempo, with deliveries to make and a future to create."
91,"All I hear is a dripping noise. At first it was their footsteps and japes. Each insult directed toward my shadow. Every syllable was another dagger to my heart. I had never wronged them, but their laughter howled and bounced and echoed hollow. It pierced my ears as they passed me, unnoticed. Just as they had passed me so often. Constantly making a fool of me. They saw me as an ape, a whipping horse. My heart thrown on a pedestal for display as it was crushed again and again beneath their cruel boots. Not once more would I play the fool. Not once more would I listen I the chorus of their gaiety. No. Our boots clacked over the stones of the bridge. My blade was silent running out of its leather home and across their throats. Their bodies dropped in loud thuds against the edge of bridge. Blood poured out onto the stones below. I stay to listen to their cruelties now, and all I hear is a dripping noise."

93,"If everything went perfectly right, her creation could drive back hell. If it went wrong, all hope for a habitable Earth would be lost. She gazed upon it once more, admiration and fear drawing a conflicted smile upon her paper face. It dominated everything, the greenhouse suddenly became the center of the Earth. Vines and mosses nestled against the globe, blending with iron valves and copper pipes. The components seemed to grow naturally, as if she had not constructed it herself, but the Earth had somehow willed it into creation. Slowly, for what could be the last time, she run her hand along the length of a fern, leading her fingers to a rusted valve. The rubber coils breathed with fluid. Sparks jumped along cables towards the thing. In awe, the woman stepped back, nearly tripping on an empty plant pot. “Holy shit ...” was all she could manage to think. This was possibly the last sanctuary of abundant life on Earth, and she was risking it all. A high metallic whine stirred in the orb, and a shudder rattled the entire room, sending birds and insects into noisy retreat. Steam hissed from all over and the whine grew exponentially in volume. Soon, she could see nothing, hear nothing. She had fallen to the ground, cowering from the beast that was awakening. There was no way of knowing whether it was a success till after. If it was a failure, she 'd probably be dead, and for all she knew, she could be dead. For an eternity her senses were void and her fear was on overdrive. At some point in the eternity, it ended. A pulse of energy shot from a short antenna above the heart, clearing the fog and bringing complete silence. Eden got to her feet, she slapped her arm, burnt like she was alive. Birdsong filled the room. It was time to see her results. Shaken, she stumbled to the window of the glasshouse. She looked out at what had been miles of barren wasteland. A tear rolled down her cheek. Fighting, struggling, life dragged itself from the scarred ground. The desert around her house on the hill blossomed with colors. The colors of life."

95,"Waking with a start, my blankets strewn wildly about my floor, thrown from my bed as I slept. It was just a dream ... It had to be; there 's no other explanation for it. But, I 've never had such a vivid dream before; not just seeing, but tasting the cold mustiness of the air, feeling the chill of the marble on the soles of my feet, hearing the quiet rustling of unseen trees, the muted clangor of steel on steel, battle cries and shouts in every language. Shaking my head and sitting up, my pillows twisted and disordered behind me, rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I look over at the wall and gawp, looking for a long moment as my cheeks flush red with a riot of conflicting feelings. -- It 's cold; my first instinct is to cover myself. Wearing only my plaid flannel pants, my toes flex against the floor, its hard surface almost slick to the touch. The guttering candles cast flickering shadows across the blue and yellow stones of the floor, send shades flitting up the length of the fluted columns lining the hall, and cloak the sides of the hall in dancing shrouds. I can almost see into the closest niche, to my left, a branch ... no, it 's been carved, so perhaps a club. Feeling drawn forward, I shiver slightly and let my feet move me further into the hall; the marble frigid beneath my feet now, drawing the heat from me, the dull roar of far off combat fading as I tread deeper into the hall. To each side, there are weapons, that much is clear, though the shadows and my need to keep walking make it difficult to catch more than a passing glimpse. As I walk though, some look vaguely familiar, a bulky hammer encrusted in runes, a finely crafted and gilded sword, displayed alongside its sheath, a Hasta, the point seeming wet with blood, even a series of bronze rapiers, gleaming brightly in the flickering light, the boar tusk helms behind them catching my eye. Moving still deeper into the shadows of the hall, a new sound reaches my ears, that of chanting, melodic and slow, singing praises, seeking benedictions, and giving devotions to God. The ecclesiastical Latin seeming somehow familiar to my ears, an instinctive understanding welling up from the very depths of my soul. To my sides now are effigies on the walls, holding their swords gently by the top of the pommel, gazing down at the path upon which I walk, seeming to both judge and welcome at once. One in particular, seems to call me off the path, my feet moving of their own volition, leading me to a towering man, his face obscured by the weathering of ages, but still conveying fierce loyalty, his cloak drawn about him as if to ward off the mountain chill. In his grip, almost singing to me now, is a sword, not as ornate as some of the others, but with a hilt inlaid with gold, small plates set over hollows along its length. The edge, though dusty and in shadow, gleams slightly, its edge seeming as sharp as the day it was made. In my gut, something tells me to take the blade and its simple sheath; so I do. The world explodes into a brilliant shimmering cascade for what feels like eternity. -- Leaning against my bedroom wall, supported by a simple, rustic kite shield, is the sword; my sword; Durendal. I can feel, almost hear, conflicted whispering in the back of my mind; one voice, very distant and faint, calling for a wife, a son, a distant homeland. The other voice, much stronger, but still a whisper, repeats a mantra in a tongue I ca n't quite understand, somewhere between French, and Latin, the tone unmistakably martial, a call to battle, a call to righteous war, a call to fight for my people, to forge anew the strength and vigor of my kin. At last, I understand. The men of the West must rise from their slumber."
96,"One morning, before you get up from bed you check your clock. 9:02am... 9:30am. God damn it, can't wait to forget. I feel like the Devil himself has tapped me on the head and all I can do is stay awake hoping that the universe works differently this time. It had been four years since she left. Why would it leave? Why did she leave me? Just don't let her come back. Just leave me alone, give me a chance to think, to be normal again. To actually start crying. I know that no matter what happens, she will not see me again. Just help me. I'm so scared. I can't take it any more. I just want her back. Please let her go. I know there will be pain tomorrow, but I can't live in that hell. I don't want to keep living like this. I am so tired. How many more hours do I have until it stops. So much pain. Too much pain. I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. If you don't want to go to heaven then please go to earth. Please. Please. And there she is, seated across from me, tears welling up in her eyes. Her cheek was so warm. I will"
97,"When a man pulls up to a guard station in some unknown desert in the middle of the wastes, all he can think is “I hope they take me for a wrong person.” Their eyes met for a brief moment, then they locked on each other. The men exchanged a slow nod of affirmation as the sounds of gunfire grew louder as they rose above the roiling of death and death and carnage. 'Yeah... maybe they 'll take me for a wrong person, eh, Stan?'Stan answered his private boss. 'Why, anyway?” Stan shook his head and smiled. The young soldier turned to face his superior, his eyes bright with the thousand's before him, but his reply was short and tentative. ``... This stuff with the old Gather and Repeat thing is getting old, Stan. They might be taking us for a wrong person.” The hulking metal walls of the madhouse made them ache for passage across the living and the dead, the raging beasts screaming in their anger and anguish at their inability to resist the embrace of death. No one dared leave their tower and walked in without having fallen to their death in the moment before the metal lifted them from the ground, where they saw the remaining men mounted on top of what they now could only imagine were crude swords and shields shaped like a face and to the armies in front of them, who were chanting and shaking"

Even the old ones, the ones who are old enough to spend most of their lives just waiting in the halls of death, do not pass on this way.” The old man shuffled his feet, his cloak billowing with each step. “I have heard of these people, one of my first masters, who could make the world the best it is now.” “Indeed, that sounds about right,” Tawthorn replied. “My eyes are merely looking to the corner.” “Ah, I see.

There had been kids at home, there was room for some action, there was fun. The forest had kept us warm so that we could grow old. We had played and had grown and got old and had grown older and found other family members. It had been a good life, but the peace was the only warmth I had.

Mark hesitated, thinking over the next question for a moment. “That's... really odd, but why were you calling me?” “You are a guy, Mark. You are a guy. You aren't a girl.

Medicine was not a need to be given, for medical research and genetic analysis allowed for brilliance and psychology which I soon found myself able to wield. I desired to impress my family, because from what I couldn't really remember, the dreams I had to study with my parents and friends were limited to what I had learned from the latest classes and sessions. I only had a lot of progress, so it only crossed me to tell my friends that I 'd take a break when my transplant happened and that I 'd be back. My friends tried to believe, but they saw how much my life was changing after they realized they never had to worry again. They left to vacate and while the hospital seemed quiet, I was captivated by the ocean. I realized that even on their backs, I felt the world beating. I always joked that I had never been given any luck. Maybe I was just lucky. Perhaps I only had a little time left. I figured that I 'd get lucky and have something with me that would impress my family, but as I waited, I began to start to think that no luck at all.

All you have to do is move them to your store and they will always buy money for you if you can make a fool out of them. There are other abilities though. Anything you can find from there just goes straight to your account. Whenever you try to look at your name on someone's shirt you start to see blueprints and fire certain buttons in your head. Some times you see something of a hit in that person's shirt and have to guess what it is.

In a 3 hour war between two nations, the technology from both parties was overwhelming. The two forces soon made contact, racing towards each other.

For all the proof that the enemy was there, the only signs of a threat was a huge ship in their trajectory. As they approached the planet, it began to start to light up.

She strained her eyes open and surveyed the room, the nurses were all chatting with her and finally they walked over to the bed and sat on the other side of her. “You're awake!” The nurse cried, “Tell him that I love him. He's starting to get better.” “He's still in the crib,” the second nurse told her, “Now take him to the bathroom, sit on the edge of the bed. You take out your pillows, cover the baby.” She kept it short, pushing the child into the crib, her little baby boy, and grabbed her pillow. “I love you, Daddy.” They whispered to the boy, “I love you too.” And began their little secret to each other.

You would be running, running, running through the walls of an underground cave, the blood of millions spilling from your side like falling drops, the grit of their skin and the bones, the strength of your warriors and their blood. A father, a man and one of his first sons. They say the wind. That they felt the cold when they would strike against the walls, the house that they had built with their loved ones, even the rocks that made their little home. The wind, howling in the trees, and how it was all that they saw. A distant and distant memory of something long gone, something that they all had forgotten. And what were they to look for? A run through the walls of a small city, a watchful night, one of the most powerful men in the world, save for his oldest friend and most trusted ally.

I am here on behalf of the Soviet Union. I'm here to condemn the atrocities committed by Moscow.” I'm trapped in a cell. This was the first time since the war had happened that I have felt fear. “Norsemen,” he begins. “We are here to punish you. The east fell under the Third Reich. We were in charge of the Soviet Union in 1930. Our experiments were considered a success but when Soviet scientists found signs of what would become of us we went after those who dared to harm our soil.” “Perhaps I should have looked further.” I chime in. “Perhaps you should.

Upon doing so you find out that she is working night shifts at a nursing home. “Where is... where am I?” A scream appeared from a mindless face in the unknown. As the curiosity for what lay beneath the fog was lifted again, the eyes saw again a robed figure standing at the foot of my bed. “Megan. She is awake. She needs you, please, take her.” A mysterious voice spoke from the darkness that seemed to come from nothing but the night. “Are you... are you...?” The voice lacked meaning, either for her, or for the other, “don't do this, Megan.

I dragged a metal needle through the odd shaped object with my right hand, its stark white surface creating a point where I clicked. I pushed in the bit of grey cloth, as before, felt a rustling sound, the air around me began to buzz with a waxy, organic fragrance.

She sits up and reaches for her leg; there's a sharp pain in her stomach, then darkness. She wakes up the next morning on the floor of the cabin with her ear and the body of her teddy bear.

There's a light in the room, a blood sucking in her face and hooking around her waist. She grins at it. She knows she 'll be happy now. The darkness is gone, her vision blurs.

She was a rather lovely woman, but almost like an ass, she was just an annoyance to my father. She brought me whole life and pain, made me feel bad for myself as well. She always wanted to be a hero, the same way she abused me, making sure I never got near the young girls with their gun which I sure didn't like. She would slap me across the face, even the faces with her eyes would hurt my eyes. She could never let go of a friend, so I was alone. Her 'normal'life was ruined. Her arm was spasming too, she 'd have her eye when I was gone, and I was sick of being a disappointment. She said she was tired, and I was starting to hate her for that. It would be the end of her for some time. I would quit that job, and become a human sacrifice.

The beautiful gem dances with a soft blue ruby that hypnotizes me. She doesn't have a bow, she just stands there, eyes fixed on the gem. “Is that... a bow?” I ask.

The only thing worth living for. I knelt down and gently placed my fingers on her face. She was crying again, but this time for other reasons. I smiled again and kissed her on the head. She had tears in her eyes, but no tears like those I had used to. She smiled back and started crying again, a lot more. I stood up and walked to the corner and sat on the edge of the yard.

There was no cure, the Fae had done so many long and hard, leaving nothing but the bones and bone left behind. As I traveled further and further, I saw the other worlds, and I started to wonder.

He was the age to be a child, but would be no more than seven by the time the group arrived on the world. The boy, Steven, was standing on the sandbank. A stranded single human stood on the desert island, far away in a corner. “Time passes in the desert island.

They approached us from all sides, trying to use their aura to invade our homes. Some people even started to hallucinate and dream, even common for Russians, and they thought they were being afraid. At first, we laughed them off, using the abundant supplies the were piling up in our basement. Then we figured out, just to be safe, that they couldn't come after us. They couldn't jump the fences or flames couldn't burn them. Maybe in the cold and comfort of here we were safe. Or at least we thought we were safe. Turns out this wasn't true for most people.

I don't know how I ever managed to hold onto that feeling, for I had never been so certain, my entire life. Until that day.

If you hadn't seen the top competitors take to the stage for the first time in years, chances were you 'd been a fool to take you. That's why it was so shocking when the winning contestant was Elvira Finkle. While humans weren't exactly perfect in all regards, they still managed to scratch their self-esteem pretty good. It was honestly frightening how they stayed healthy and happy throughout that one match. Humans could be considered the oddity. Humans are the only humans alive who used to be considered even half the world's species. What most would call a *little* odd were humans were considered so boring. We were played up as what we could possibly be. Well, not quite the *game*. When I was a boy my friends would ask me to come over to see the stadium. My mother would always tease me that I had to come to see this place.

We made plans to meet up after school, but I was told that my mother and I would be trying to get to see the stadium when it closed. It was going to be a long day, and it was going to be nice to not have to deal with being invited. I was completely engrossed in the real thing, so much so that I didn't even notice that my old classmates were staring at me. The closest one was God, the God of Vengence.

All of them were gunned down. I remember being a teenager. My own father was a war hero. We were taught to guard the A-class, a military transport. At some point during the war, when the bombs dropped on our world, we fell from the sky. Our mothers and fathers hid. My brother and sister spent the night at night. My cousin Lucie never saw her father again. When the bombs dropped, we fled. When I was a teenager I was brought up to be around the big boys in the militia. We used the name of corporal Joe. Some people in the militia were the soldiers of peace. Those that didn't returned to our lives. These soldiers of peace were cut down immediately. They had to be carted to the barracks, then the general store, then out. They died of fear in seconds, but we managed to outlast them one by one. They told stories of the horrors that the government had to inflict on us. Many of them never had any kids to look after, but their boys and sisters began to worry. They told of the battlefield that fought them. They said they fought with sticks and stones, and shooting at each other. None of them remembered anything of the battles that ended on the 10th anniversary of the attack on their front lines. The commander of my unit was put in charge of one of the boys. He was on our payroll for months, and for the longest time, he had to talk to us. He talked about the death of his brother-in-law after he was deployed. He asked us, “why do they do that? Why is this happening to us?” I always told him about the fear that his country faced in the war. I told him about my father's life, he would say, but he would never speak about his father. One day, after the war, he and his boys went off to war with some other guys. They wanted some tough jobs, too. They"
386,"The passage from God to me is excruciating. I had lived in my body a long time since I was tested and myself deemed fit for the rest of life. I fought my own wars against my parents, my peers and my oppressors, but it wasn't enough. I still had to work hard to climb my way up. We have had all the servants on our planet given command of the instruments. The scientist named Roman had developed a device to send messages in there that can transmit a signal that is directly sent back at earth. It is an ancient technology, a useless trade secret. I have it on my collar, strapped in my pants and in the pocket of my black coat, but it will suffice. I have spent much of my life in this position. The scientists had attempted to communicate to our world the technology for the purpose of locating a source of death but our physical forms and technology were severely weakened by the concentration of it. We have held them hostage for nearly a century, learning their language and ideas. I had built a small device capable of bringing their technologies back to our planet and through it found out that they were experimenting on us. I came up with the plans to communicate with them, using how I had calculated the length of time we would have left at each communication. I had prepared for this, as I had, for hundreds of years. I was in no state to be around those sorts of things. The scientist had provided all of us with human technology. I had hoped that after more decades of training and experimenting, I would feel invincible and not just for a few more hours of human life, but at the same time be constantly tested and learning the new systems and procedures. The scientists had allowed me to be in charge, an everyday citizen of the planet. I had made it as far as I could from the cold wastes to the plains. Once I was alone I heard the opening doors of a nuclear reactor spewing radiation. I had only time to wonder how the world had changed. I didn't know what to do.

I sat down in the chair across from Joe and ordered my coffee. I 'd made one before, I 'd kept it for a while. Now it was just tea and hot water. When Joe opened the door, there were no outside visitors, the wind and the rain were only visible on the windows, the fluorescent lighting made it out of the building and into the air, so I didn't know where it came from. “Joe, I'm sorry I had to pick this up. I'm not sure what you said, you said that you could take a drink from the vending machine but that it's expired, that I didn't know what to do.” Joe frowned, he 'd looked up from his cup to see me and almost jumped into a seat. He walked up to the machine and switched off the tap, “It's okay,” He seemed very serious, he just looked at the cup, “This is an invitation” he took out his phone, you could hear him typing a joke, “We're setting up meeting in our offices, just come to the meeting hall and we 'll have a table there, have a drink” He didn't even look at me and glanced around the coffee shop, a lot of people were sitting on the tables, walking and laughing. “Can I ask Joe what's going on, you know we're having a meeting on Friday morning” he said, he took out his phone,"

William smirked as he lifted a fork to hers, and suddenly her gaze swiveled downward, away from her to focus on a red line she had seen printed on a shirt she was wearing. She turned her face back toward the TV to watch. “What?” she asked. William shrugged, shuffling back his chair and resting it gently on the arm rest. “What are you talking about?” Jane eyed the wide-eyed brunette next to William. “Well, no, but why are you wearing red now?” “Well, a lot of people will still be listening to this right now,” said William, with a twist of his very body, “and I, well...

William sighed, one hand on his face and the other firmly at his chin. “Well, I guess that's just part of the game then.” Jane took off her sweater and followed the blonde toward the kitchen, where the hallway was dark and bright enough that any person would see.

389,"This is kind of what I write in a post. Yes, of course I'm aware of the limitations and limitations of humanity, as I have claimed to be a beacon of great goodness throughout the ages. At least, as far as human beings are concerned. So long as I can take care of my natural condition, I can effectively force those who are suffering to the cause. It's not like I'm trying to give them the cause, just to force them to show up and claim my existence, but it's the only way to help them. The very act of granting someone's life is not a simple one. There are no stipulations of our punishments, there is no physical punishment. You're free to die your mortal life, regardless of whether your body produces the physical or physical penalty of eternal suffering. But what does that have to do with anything? As I am sure you can imagine, it's quite pleasant seeing my brethren. Though the life I've come to lead consists entirely of so much suffering, it's not that I think it's bad. It's just that it's been very hard to do so, if it were possible to do so in such a finite amount of time. I'm sure there is a certain part of you that we've found joy in and always wanted to help. The kind of happiness that is only found when the guilty have already shown themselves to be guilty. I've realized though, that even a punishment like this wouldn't be so hard if there were none. But alas, the punishment doesn't last very long. It just never does. I realize now that the part that I chose to grant is a human's life. One day, I 'll be ruling them over, or torment them, and bring them into my world. Those are the rules, and the executioners will have control of the morality of the decision. In my little cage, there is nothing to control except how they feel about me. I couldn't possibly lead them to choose whether or not to torture them. There's no way I could have brought them into this world, so how could I bring them to my lair, to all these nightmare horrors? Why couldn't I have, what could be worse? Why should it matter"

It reminds me a bit of the smell of freshly smoked ham and cheese. I sit back at my chair. The wisps of steam are nothing compared to my first encounter with it. I make a cup of tea. I drink it before the light turns on. As I drink, a few seconds pass. Then it has a new sense of brightness. The real power comes from the tiny square of thin plastic. I look at it. This is a new age. Something new is emerging. I pull it from my purse. “Hello?” “What is it?” “This thing is made of hydrogen, nukes or something.” ``...

392,"I was a twenty something. My life was beginning to suck. The pill was getting stronger. At first, I had said goodbye to my husband to an unlikely health-watchdog, who stayed up reading the latest episode of “Deep House.” It was then that I realized, apparently I never got to stay at his house. I was getting tired. I was breaking up with my “goodnight love” brother. He was one of my best friends. He just never came home because he had a bad memory, and I never understood why his body was always in the same position that it was the last night. I wasn't sure why he missed the bike ride. He needed a ride. I just didn't want to be late to my fiance's funeral. As soon as he left the house, the lights switched on. I had no idea how long it had been since I had left. I had tried to spend more time with my fiancée, but she was always in my room. She would yell at me when I saw the firetrucks, but she was always at my door when I went to bed. It had been almost ten years since the pill had taken me. I was thirty. I was almost fifty. I could not deal with the fact that I had to work late to pay for my degree. I wouldn't eat anything I could cook for the cash register. As soon as the toothbrush fell out, the darkness descended. There was nothing I could do. As I fell to the floor, I lay there, shocked. My stomach was practically over. “Who are you?!” I screamed. “I think I'm going to die!” “No! That's not what I said!” “Get up!” I collapsed onto the floor, and I heard my brother screech,” you stay with me. You will live longer. You 'll have sex with more people. We 'll live longer, you will die.” I don't remember that night. I thought I was mad, that I should go on, but the pill took over."
393,"The box of blue pills was done, ready to go into the medicine cabinet and be thrown out. I took two of them out, making sure not to take my tongue out of my mouth. Only the mucous and shit stung my nose. I didn't need my tongue in my mouth anymore, and that's what saved me. So I held the box in my mouth for one full day. The stench and the shit got worse. So now that the drugs are out of the way I had to leave for work. The chaos started shortly after that, I stopped caring about my own body, my own health, and just stopped caring about how I was going to survive. I was just a regular human being, if I had one. It was just a matter of surviving. No one could hurt me if I did. My phone still ran, that worthless piece of shit that must have allowed me to survive, is still working perfectly. I was the only one with a signal, I had to wait until they were clean before I found another one. In a rush, I just left the box behind. I never want to know who just happened to get infected. I never want to know that my loved ones didn't just pass away, there was no other way. Oh well, we 'll see what we can do. If anything happened, I 'd blame them."
394,"The war seemed to have been the only thing that saved my life. It seemed almost as if we had been killed by a very few people. I think the last event that happened was on a street corner. People were walking down it when one of them got hit in the face with a gun. I am not sure where he fell to or why. We don't know for sure. Whatever story was told was incredibly newsworthy, and it was spread to the whole world. But I don't care. The final story that happens is that I didn't want to die. The very last thing I wanted to do was to die on my own. I'm not really sure where it came from, but it came in waves. Someone just died on my doorstep. Something had to be done. People started freaking out because some story wasn't broadcast and not any news. People blamed the war on some stupid kid in the seventh grade who thought he was going to die because he got too excited. That was also the story that turned on the news. The war isn't over yet. Now it's almost over. I think that's enough to convince me that I am better off."
395,"After an impossible journey, the way home had come to a close. I would have begged for death if I had not been so torn up by what had happened, thinking nothing would come of it. So I stayed with their family and they watched me as I grew older. I looked into their eyes, reflected in their expression of fear and panic and in their gaze of joy. I believed their name was but the one word in their last words. All that remained of that one name was that one. He had sacrificed his life, but he had lived on. He had loved, he had loved, he had loved. It was enough. He had died a long time ago. At this point, our lives had been determined by what kind of devilish plan we were faced with. I haven't told you why, but I don't want to lie to you, but I don't think we were meant to be able to do it. He was only an infant. The most he ever did was just fall asleep during another parent's final days. He saw us. He thought he was going to die with him. He did. But I didn't see his death as the end. He was doing so for himself, knowing he would live on in the world. He saw the fulfillment in it, but for a time he thought it wasn't his own. He thought he had already lived and loved, but now his loneliness was too much. He had lost the effort, it was what he needed. He never meant to, never imagined that he would. His body stopped responding to anything and it was a matter of seconds before his mind shut down. He didn't think it would be his life to die alone. He had no right to do so. He was destined to be alone forever. It didn't help at all, though. He knew that life was not all it had once been. He saw the dark hands of the devil looking back at him, and his breathing became heavy with doubt. He didn't know how long he was out there. He had to know what was happening to him. He didn't know why he did what he did. He had a duty. And he knew he did not have the time to keep him here. But he"
396,"Ezzie broke off the morning tram before making her way to the boardwalk. “Hey Josh.” Josh smiled as he arrived at the DMV. He was clean-shaven with long black hair and a shirt that barely seemed to fit. He had the look of a saint; one that made Greg laugh. He was practically God-like. Josh shook Josh’s hand as they crossed the white corridors, and “Yeah, Josh.” Josh turned his attention back to the boardwalk. His heart wasn’t in it. This man would be passed out for hours if he didn’t stop and stare at the ground. He wasn’t actually hungry. “Josh?” Greg tried to speak but found himself sputtering out. Josh just looked down at his knees and picked up the clipboard. “Why are you staring at the ground?” “I was going to go say something about everyone being the same in life. He should have just said ‘ Hey, josh, where’s the boardwalk?’” Josh shook his head. “That’s not how we dress, Josh.” “Is there some sexual tension?” Josh frowned and put a hand to his mouth. “Look, Josh. ‘ Hey, Josh, hold on to this…I don’t know what’s going on.’I know you're here for this. You could just take off your pants and you’ll be fine.” Josh started to lean over to put his hand on Josh’s shoulder. “I know, I know, and I’m not here to judge or anything. But if we do make it out of here, I’m going to tell you one thing right now.” Josh smiled. “I’m sorry. I know it’s confusing but we can still call you and say"
397,"I suppose I may never feel this good knowing you know about me. Your laugh is my greatest pleasure. I can hear you smile as you watch the mouse, feeling my true feelings and making new and wonderful feelings for those I love. I remember how you made me laugh so hard that I had to close my eyes and stop shaking. In my dream, I could hear you laugh so hard, and yet, I didn't hear you move. The mouse didn't move and I slowly closed my eyes. I was scared, unable to move. The next morning I woke up. My face is flush with fear. I feel so tired, and while I work, I am anxious, and have the feeling that I would lose this opportunity for joy. I had been lying in bed for almost an hour and every movement felt like it was hours ago. I sat up, I yawned, and I tried to speak but the smooth words wouldn't move. I woke up to the sound of some joke and a smell of booze, the sound of other people laughing and I could not speak. My head hurt. I turned my eyes up and did not see that mouse. I couldn't move. I felt nauseous. I just wanted to go home, and drive myself to some church and then home and... sleep. I cried for almost an hour and then some more to get out of this feeling. I felt like I should probably leave home but I wasn't going anywhere. I asked what I could do to be okay and my chest felt like it was being squeezed, and then I felt my chest felt like a warm blanket, warmer than the comfort of my own bed. I didn't need to open my eyes. I could tell my chest was going to burst open, and this time it wasn't a big one. I tried to cry but was too weak to speak. Then I cried. The world went dark. I woke up again. My lips open and my eyes only open. I see nothing. I see a stranger approaching. He is long and is very short. He wears a wide brimmed hat and gray robe with faded. And his eyes look like you wouldn't believe. They are blue and there is a small pause when he speaks. <new"
398,"My soulmate was born with golden skin, well-kept hair, but we both saw the first day she became mine. For years we made love with each other, but there was always a tug in the back of our minds. Could we be with each other? Once we moved to a new city, we had a friendly chat, and the next day we moved back to Florida, to start our careers. Two years before, I fell in love with my reflection. It happened so fast. She and I had been in a car crash, and I saw her in the mirror. She looked amazing in all her glory. The black hair bounced around her face and she hugged me as tight as she could, only to laugh as tears fell from her eyes. She cried a lot, and I cried a lot, but I could still hear her voice. I watched her once more as she laughed at herself. I knew something was wrong, but I never did know what to do. “Hey, you!” She called. “Oh, look at that.” “What?” I said. “My reflection.” She said. “Oh. That was so easy.” I said. We were finally happy. It's funny how it all came to a head when we realized she was the only one who could ever really love me. We were finally happy."
399,"To whom it may concern, “I’ve always wanted to go back.” The one thing to remember is that even in my time, I didn’t want to miss a bit of history and memories. The mistakes I made, the small decisions I took, the rough places I was placed, my victories, the pity I’d put into those past. But time’s all around me. Time follows me, as it always does. To no one but me, it tells me I am still a human being and it is time to forget those atrocities. I tried to be peaceful, I tried to be merciful, I tried to be my own man. But I was always afraid to do so. Still, the thing to remember is that even in my time, I couldn’t come close to being merciful. I tried to make a name for myself in history, of the people I had ever killed, the places I was raised. I tried to keep myself from meeting people who didn’t know me well, to be nice to myself. But all I could find was a smile to my face, and in that smile, I felt pain. That smile is why I do it, I always do. I watch as the sights and sounds of cities rise and fall, the landscapes stretch and expand, the people we helped disappear in the years to come. I watch as those once majestic places fall to the mere question of how I might be remembered. And I see that the universe will do nothing to change the fact that I am here. I will continue to be a people of hope and joy, not of despair or cruelty. I will continue to watch as the savages and other scum of humanity try to set off a nuclear fire in my honor. I will continue to watch as the idea of injustice, the tragedy of history, is twisted into something monstrous. I will continue to watch as a murderer, an abuser, a thief. I will continue to watch as the children grow up. And as one man, one mother, one child, a man who’d cry for his wife, I’ll watch as"
400,"The captain whistles over his crew, one salute, and walks out into the chilly October night. The whole group stares up at him in awe as he enters the Europaic Deepspace Proving Ground. A great flicker in the form of heat can be seen in the fronds that surround the once mighty city. The officials were all pointing their cameras towards the sky, floating out like a movie set with no setting. Strangely, however, no one looked up from their monitors. “Good morning, workers” he greets them one after the other. “Captain?” “Oh, so are you alright? It is only eight o'clock, eh?” He looks down at his hands, and the once white numbers of his office jingle as the metallic plates underneath his chair give a false cheer. His nameplate reads “I intend to make this a productive day.” “Uhm, yeah, I think I should go and do some schoolwork for the trip.” He closes his eyes and silently winds up his lunch. “Fine, sir, the trip will be a beautiful one, we can do some serious *growing* in the year ahead. We were hoping that our son-in-law didn't land early,” the young, bearded and short-faced man behind the camera continues to speak. “Don't be so humble, I know you're studying hard. You should be doing more schoolwork, yes?” “No, no no, I'm really tired right now,” the man is beginning to sound ragged, and looks down at his arms. “Look, we need to go to school, I will make sure he doesn't land early. We need to discuss why he landed early.” The two men stop in their tracks, and stare at the sky. A flicker, and the flare a flash out. The NASA engineers will be putting up a real test of their new technology in 2023."
401,"Freddy dropped the dildo down to his two cardboard cutouts and, mumbling something under his breath, with a hand on his gun, slumped down to the ground. He then gently picked up his stack of toys from the table and began to unhook them before tackling Joey to the ground with the spare parts. “Mr. Krueger is no Mr. Rogers” Before him lay an umbrella and a USB stick, the contents of which were also, on the table, an empty plastic bag with the odd “empty” letter opener attached, but again, he already began removing the toys. “Uh, hi Mr. Rogers” “He's acting odd”, Mr. Krueger muttered. “Fine”, Freddy said without even listening to his thoughts and began to dismantle the cardboard cutouts, draining them of all color, and gracing the remaining leg of his green and blue costume. The security guards watched with a mix of bewilderment and skepticism as Freddy hacked into the plastic bag, ripping the door shut and engaging the airlock. He then sat on the ground, arms spread, not holding his breath. “Well, I really want to know who did this.” “Who is this Mr. Krueger”, the taller one said before turning his attention to Freddy. “I don't know”, he mumbled The shorter one sighed. “Well, I have been looking for clues in the case...” “So, we now have a specific phone call. How do we get it?” “Well...” “We can just call you Bob, we're at the office”, Bob replied, almost as if he knew what he was being asked “Wh-what?” Freddy exclaimed “Who are you?” “We have a police response, we've been looking for clues. There's been an armed"
402,"Even though it was only weeks ago that both Zuckerberg and I were launching Facebook, it was still unnerving. The world was so numb with the demise of our country, and the suicide of many in it. Zuckerberg's primary goal was to delete Facebook and kill all the most important people in society. He was testing it out by attempting to disable the iPad. But when he realized how advanced the device was, he decided to stop all the reddit content from reaching everyone. He shut all the doors of this country down and replaced the digital forms with digital memories of you online. However, when the thousands of users he erased began to burn into the earth and die, Zuckerberg was devastated. “How did this happen?” Zuckerberg asked himself. “What am I supposed to do?” He put the iPad to his ear. It had been activated at 9am on July 3rd, 2009. Now, after 100 years of ridicule and ridicule, people can read your mind. Zuckerberg sighed and plugged the device into his ear. As soon as it did, the screams of thousands started in the background of the tablet. It was after about 15 minutes when Zuckerberg realized what was happening. He walked back to his house and moved his friends and family. He had not slept well last night. When he arrived, he was met by the table of his uncle. “Do you mind if I bring you breakfast?” He asked. “I should go.” “Alright, we 'll get you that breakfast soon.” Zuckerberg blinked at the smile on his uncle's face. He took the apple he was holding and he gave a small smile. He ate his breakfast, set his bag of chips and headed outside. As he walked down the street, he felt some sadness. He was never really a very good guy and he was quite a big fan of Richard Dawkins. He let out a howl as he walked by the “Dawkins”. “Dawkins, why do you feel so bad?” Richard asked. “I know you're losing"
403,"A tiny black box in my pocket. I, on a side street maybe two blocks away, got shot in the eye. It was the smallest thing I owned, but it was valuable. I had one shot at this, just one bullet that was enough for one person. It was so small I didn't understand what was going on. I sat in my car as I left. It wouldn't come back, that was how it was meant to be. It just... wasn't. I took a deep breath and reached for the “Memory To Memory” box. A small piece of paper that said “Memory To Memory”. ... what was that for? I looked at the square piece of paper, and wondered what would happen if I knew. I closed my eyes and closed my mouth. There was nothing left to know. There would be no happiness. No pain. I closed my eyes again and closed my mouth. The smile on my face was over. There was nothing left. I turned my car around and walked down to the parking lot. It's in the back of the store. It had a red sticker, “RedBoxRecorder32”. It was labeled “RedBoxToMemory To Memory”. It was set up on the back wall to be easy to open if you weren't careful. I walked out of the parking lot. No more money was spent. No payback. I got inside. I took the back door and entered. There was a space underneath a filing cabinet. I put the box on the ground and put it in the trunk. I opened up the black box. I took it out and looked at it. I looked at the picture, my wife. I looked at the ticking timer on my phone. I looked at the picture"
404,"They waited outside the church of the hosain, waiting for someone to come forward and give their opinion on the word of God. Anyone for that matter. It was no stretch to say that this was the seventeenth time in human history the subject had been debating on this simple speech for at least thirty seconds. I started to gather up my microphone and noticed a lot of people gathered around the pulpit to consider this. If I hadn't already decided that this was the word of God, they would have picked it up on the pulpit itself. “People of the holy faith! We have decided to debate on this one topic today. Would you like a moment to listen?” One man spoke, who, as the old hands have to say, was outfitted with a tattered cloth which made him look like he was trying to calm the person down. “Hello Mr. Sanders! If you would be so kind to listen to us, I would suggest that you attend a local football team or team that you attend football games with.” “I'm Christian. I attend the Mormon Church. I'm from Utah and I also attend the Catholic Church.” I offered, as a few of the other voice candidates started to act a little calmer. I noticed that they all seemed to cheer for my choice and to take a step back in recognition of my talk. “Well, you see, you have heard that the nation of Israel has banned the school and clubs of Jehovah's Witnesses. I believe that those places should be denounced because of this stupid little thing called the Bible, if you will. As you might be aware, it says that there is an ancient saying which states that the Bible's followers are commanded to die as men. This tradition was later challenged in the early modern history of the United States. By the late 18th century, people began to hear that there was a Word of God from the future.” “So now we have our own Bible, how about you, gentlemen, which you might understand as leading people to want to know about what would have happened had they not given a separate damnation to the bible?” “No. I have no idea.” The old man looked at me again, a wave of realization"
405,"Day Seven: *You won't believe how often this will happen. I still don't know how I've been able to get it out of my head, but there's just been one person who I really want to get this out of my head. Her name is Lilith. She's my coworker. She's been working here for 2 years. The only way I can be able to get her out of my head is if I work the desk. * Day 12: *If you are watching the news, I must make you a note. I want everyone to know that you are going to be fighting on the front lines. However, the more details you get, the harder it is for me to understand. * Day 13: *It's been three years since my “blackout”. I still have the contacts I have now. How many have I made? Not one. I don't know. How many others have made me run out of the office? * Day 15: *Do you know what the government has done to keep people in the dark? They have barred contact with me for 2 years. All the information is stored here. I don't know. * Day 16: *Everything has been raided by the NSA. Even the cell phones they have left. No phones, no cameras, no maps, no computers, no anything except an abandoned computer and my work phone. There are no other way to make a phone call. * Day 17: *I still work for the NSA. I believe this is what I want to be doing. I'm still not sure how I've been able to get this out of my head. * Day 18: *I don't think I 'll ever be able to get out of my head.

406,"She was warm and quite a beautiful, she could bear to put my hand on her shoulder, yet more so than those of many other people. Though, I could not place how warm she was, something about the way she warmed my skin made me think, that if I touched her, I would feel what the world knew about me as real to me as the warmth of her presence. I saw the way her head turned, she was focused, she was calming, and yet so... She was so warm and I was so sad. I could only gaze upon her helpless eyes in one moment, and then gaze at the black in the corner of my eye as they were trained on me and I saw her hazel eyes. We looked at each other in the only possible way, as though our soul couldn't decide if we could wait. And in that moment I knew I would lose her."
407,"Her first love was my daddy and she had been six before we got married. I was eleven, but she was the only one of us with kids at our school. We got to have at least two. I was fifteen when we found out about a secret, so I wanted to know how she got pregnant. I want to see her with her son, Maddie. He would always tell me stories about how her family had been raised to be your grandparents. Now my best friend, Niles, is going to be eight years old. His mother already thought of him with a smile when he was born, but she was a little concerned that he would have twins when they were grown up. My dad was always great with that. My mom and I adopted Maddie around Christmas, and when Maddie was fourteen she had our first baby girl, probably May. It was a girl named Rebecca. We would always say hi to each other, and we would always go out for drinks, go to some special places, enjoy ourselves, and feel like we were a family. But as the years went by, my best friend, Morgan had another son, Jerry. Jerry was nine when he was born. It was right before we got the divorce. So I was fifteen when Maddie decided she had twins and was supposed to go with them. At fifteen she chose to live with them. Maddie had a lot of responsibilities to worry about but she wanted to raise our child with as many people as she could. She even had a form for us at this point. Niles was eight and was a poor mom. She worked hard in school, she had a job, she got into university, she worked for her son while he was on his own. Maddie was fifteen and was a really good kid and her kid had lots of friends who were there for her at parties and soccer practice. She worked so hard to stay in school, but she was almost sixteen. I knew that Maddie's dad worked hard and she saw that as all good things. So I had to go to the doctor. Niles had something I hadn't thought of. She would give me pills when we came in the hospital. I would sometimes tell her the truth, but never believe it. The doctor told her that I needed to go in to a doctor's office"
408,"Everything got a little a little clearer for me. Everyone's supposed to be just up and moving, who knew how I felt at the time? Or, rather, everyone's supposed to feel like they're in the zone; they don't experience any real feelings, there is no space to exist and no desire to hurt someone. If I do feel I'm alone, it's because the universe is playing tricks on me, watching me and thinking I'm something special, being bored of my own personal life and wondered what my life could be like. There is no one to see this for me. Maybe I'm going insane and realizing that I've never felt more alive in my entire life; somehow, I have to look in the mirror to check that I have a true sense of self; but no one cares how you feel like you're happy. I feel in a way that everyone else sees in the same way, completely different. Just me, sitting in a chair and smiling to myself every morning while having the same perfectly manicured beard; I've somehow seen myself in the mirror so many times in all my life that I find myself amazed. But the weird thing is, I feel like I never saw myself before; every time I do, the only time I can put my foot down is when I get up to say something and actually move the world around me, with no real idea what to say. I'm hoping that one day, someone's making me feel like I have the answers to every question and was a part of an experiment to get myself to say them. My ceiling is a lot wider than the one I'm sitting in and I don't feel in any of the rooms at all. My bed is flat, but it seems that it is the only thing I can see through it. I'm not sure why the door is closed in the middle of nowhere and this wasn't a normal dream, or the pills. It's not like I did anything in this life that was outside of the norm or anything. I only feel from the side, not from my chest, or to the ceiling. I'm just the air in here, I think, but I'm"
409,"The smell of car oil, curry paste and cream mixed in with the warmth of rinds and paprika on a hot summer day could be no doubt imprinted on her body. A morning that felt like a bic-line meant one that could be tracked and re-attempted to have a successful spring. Even if she was not perfectly healthy she knew that if she needed another feeding she would come to bed exhausted. Not only that, she had to work with it. Working on the day it would occur should a doctor, one that was out of her way or otherwise unnecessary or unpredictable could arise to deliver her meal. This helped her in deciding whether or not to approach new food stores. The smell of curry paste mixed with the heat of rinds and paprika on a hot summer day could be no doubt imprinted on her body.

This helped her in deciding whether or not to approach new food stores. As a small child she liked to grow up thinking that a cat was the most likely cat food source in her house. Of course, she also often wished for a cat of her own. With only one relationship and a small base she was more comfortable with providing for her cats and their owners. These simple interactions with animals were ingrained into her mind for years. Over time they became an anchor to her mind. She made them to the world and that sense of order of living she had so been rooted in. Perhaps she had learned to love animals too. After all she didn't need to get any attention from them, she could still lay awake through the night."
410,"I said, “Son, it's not your fault. This whole thing has already happened to you, and you're saying it's for the better?” He wouldn't hear me! Just like always he wouldn't hear me! Why did I have to do this to myself? What was the point in having a real boyfriend! When did he realise who I was! I am a healthy, happy kid! This fucked up, I'm a big boy! I got married to Miss Deedes, has three beautiful kids and gets that inheritance in cash! I loved her, she said, I love her, she loved me, and all I've ever been through is watching myself get denied a parent's 'cure'and fucking my friends for being who they are. However, things have been different since I'm 12. Like I said, I wasn't allowed to go to my fathers house to watch my dads life end. I'm not a person of anger. I'm not angry at my mother. I'm angry at my friends. I'm not angry at mom. At my parents. I'm not angry at everyone! What was it like? This whole thing to me has had horrible consequences, I just want my parents back! I want to say goodbye, please, don't do this! I'm not even alive! I'm not even alive! But I'm here now! Right now, my friends aren't around! They're around my friends, everybody is standing with me. Some are staring, asking me questions, or some just fiddling with my hair. I'm here. Right now. This doesn't make sense, he has to tell me everything, just like I always have, or I wouldn't be a part of this situation. But here's the deal, I will tell him, what I know, and I will be able to fix this. He can see it in my eyes, it's like he sees me playing with my hair. I'm bleeding. Not just from the cut, but from everywhere. My head hurts. Blood everywhere, everywhere! Why is"
411,"Never sleeping, has never had to, and doesn't suffer physically from this condition. This is exactly what happened to me. The old man who sat in front of me had his head buried in his hands, begging for me to help him get through the day. For some reason, he thought, I didn't have to get through the day. He was lying next to me, telling himself he 'd get through this and that I 'd be there for him as well. As the young man scurried away in tears, he listened to the stories I told to my father about how I 'd been crazy when I was younger, how I 'd been sick, but how he just smiled when he told the truth. When I 'd told him my stories of my teenage years, it wasn't exactly a surprise. The old man just nodded and nodded and nodded. He thought he 'd be able to tell me what was going on if I told him. Of course, there was no way I was going to let that happen. We weren't the only ones in the country without a doctor. My father's job was a division of the FBI. He was the only one that gave me any sort of special treatment for depression, so to speak. I 'd looked through my file at the time I 'd left. It had the same bold “psychiatric wards” all over it. It seemed like the only way to get them to send people back to the past, anyhow. It was like sitting in the same room with a friend, all night, talking to them. When I 'd asked my dad what my cause of distress was, his voice cut through my thoughts. “As long as you're thinking about life and loved ones, we're really not hurting anyone.” I figured it was because I was young, I 'd been diagnosed with depression. I wouldn't be here any time soon, and I was desperate for anything. I 'd been a junior in high school, my real intelligence the first year after I 'd gotten my degree. Now, I was stuck in"
412,"“It's so funny, dude,” he said, grabbing the ceramic knife in his belt pocket, “did you even think to do this?” That was good-natured banter, he thought, looking at the pulsing red orb hovering just above the table. Which it was, but he wasn't sure. A trickle of sweat ran down his forehead. They had been planning this up for so long, from first birth to teenage pregnancy to adolescence. If they couldn't keep it in check, why waste their own resources with medical exams? He spat it out, still reeling. He never said it was a bad idea. The family had lived comfortably with the family for nearly a decade. Their heart had been filled with the love and joy of their life, and their mother had not seen a day without their best friend. It had been their honeymoon, and all he wanted was to be there to witness it. The man wasn't sure exactly what he was doing. *No, this wasn't just a good idea. * He thought. *No one ever talked about any of this. * The last thing he wanted was to try and make it worse. He felt his arms move as he gazed out the windows as he slowly recoiled from his chair. This was going to be a terrible day. He must have a concussion, or something. He swore to himself and dropped the knife onto the table. The glow of the blue orb lit up the room, and he let out a primal laugh. He ran up to the table, grabbed his napkin, and began to head to the bathroom. All the better, he thought as he turned on the lamp, casting a thin line across the mirror. His eyes caught a glimpse of the phone. *I know I didn't expect to get the call, but I 'll be back shortly. *"
413,"The pinking of the Tardis indicated the end of the lead pipe, or so I thought. Only the spines of countless limbs pierced the air and were the smooth substance of suspended gas flowing through the pipes. I stood in awe, wondering what this was all for. An expensive gift from our owner. A dare, perhaps, and a promise that only a king could take. A life on the best side. “Good evening ladies, gentlemen.” I said to the men around me as I left, ready to explain why I was here. For some reason, those few who remained were oddly interested in my work. Surely, though, if I wanted to know about our curse, I would have to take advantage of the loophole and slip up on an expedition. This, too, was my reward for my previous efforts. What I found out next, I could not have anticipated. My eyes began to water as they held the severed arm of my head, smiling with such satisfaction I almost lost it. Our task was to kill or extract one of the syringes which, in this day and age, meant to allow a creature more easily to be released into the world. Yet, as we made our way to where I had broken the money, the men and women beside us became more and more interested in the important details, such as whether a pig stole the tardis. A gruesome scene unfolded as I slipped into the pit in front of the pit. A shiny, round, metallic object lay where my body once stood, the exterior of the scythe right next to me. I was only able to make out tiny bumps from the wound, and was now excited to see who would be the last one to pick it up. “A syringe!” One of the men exclaimed from the other room. I scanned the room looking for anyone I could use as bait for the hidden darts I had used so as to lure down whatever they were planning to use. “A syringe!” I shouted to the three men around me. “What's the price?” I asked, hoping to avoid any discussion as I considered who would be the last one to pick it up. “Go away!” The one that called me on my silent panic and"
414,"“Dear everyone. My name is Thomas Reed. As I was about to leave, a pair of cowboy boots arrived in front of me, and from their clothing came a small furry man in a red sandal. He carried a rusted cigar, lit with yellow. The cigar, bright in the sun, ran up into his finger and blew smoke into my hand. I had to go to the restroom to get the cigar, but it seemed safe, so I gathered up the little man and went home. As I was walking home, Thomas disappeared in the crowd, but before he left, he was joined by two smaller blobs, a puddle of black and blue water, and a large dark man in a leather coat. I could not believe what I was seeing. “Mr. Reed, you may be in a more real situation. A little press conference later, there is another unexpected story on the news. A stranger from the Smithsonian states that he has reached a tipping point in human society. He and a very special human are looking for him.” “That's fantastic news, sir. I've been working on this for weeks.” “You know, at this point in time, I wouldn't have noticed the enormity of the problem. A human is a human. It wasn't always like this, there were some heroes like myself.” “Do you see yourself in this situation, sir?” “Well... we came across a gentleman. Apparently, some firefighters got out of the way. Naturally, that is where I looked into it. This is insane, Mr. Reed, but what do you think,” he paused, and said, “of what is happening?” “I don't know. I think I am the only man who can understand why humans try to keep dying.” “You could feel something else too. Something horrible.” “Excuse me?” “Yes. We know humans look different from others, but that is no reason to kill them. What's more, those who got their hands on these creatures seem to have"
415,"“It has been many years since the time of the war. For generations, scientists and soldiers have journeyed across the galaxy, searching for this ancient relic. To have been lost to history, forgotten. Yet, somehow, this relic has haunted me ever since. I swear, I will never forget, and my arms, my eyes, my body, will never be the same.” “That is a sad story. For the future generations, we will have an expedition on this faraway planet. It is a mission that you are all here to fulfill. Do not fear, I will not be able to find it. There is an ancient village nearby, still alive despite the radiation. You will save those lives. Leave them here.” ``... No, sir, I will not. I haven't seen anyone ever since I was in space, you know. And I will never be able to forget how I felt when they decided to abduct me. I tried to tell them that I didn't care for humanity, that we didn't need them, that I was the one who created them. But they didn't believe me. They never listened, and now, they want me to repeat that.” The two men walk for a moment, and then John and Harold look at the ground. They start moving as fast as they can. John presses his head against the back of his head, and whispers into Harold's ear. “This old device, man! We will never forget it! You can never forget! This machine can save them from extinction!” They keep on walking."
416,"They always say I have the greatest life experience in the world. As a kid, I made it. I found a place with the right amount of money, and the right people. I just want a little more. I just want to be me. I really did. I know I'm sick and tired of it all, but I don't mind. I don't mind spending the last year and a half of my self-worth on something important. No family, no friends, nothing really. It's all true. I'm just stuck in the old, purgatory of poverty. You see, when I moved out of the country of my birth, and decided to have my own little home in my family's bungalow in the suburbs of New York City, I decided to get a cabin and settle down a little. It took me another 5 years to realize that I have a wife, two kids and a large family, but there's nothing special about her. Nothing boring, just a house, food, and a smile. I grew up in a small town, in the big, open city, where kids weren't allowed in to the old houses because they didn't fit the mold. I never knew my life would be like this, but something about her and the fact that she would eventually disappear, I had to pick up the pieces. I guess the most amazing part of life is the freedom. Not being forced to do the things I've always wanted to do. See the next person, feel the distant glances of the conversations that went on between them, make sure there's someone who cares about me. But I don't know how I do it, and it is the absolute worst thing anyone could do. I have an amazing family, a quiet little town, beautiful summer nights, free summer weekends. I even have two children, and I'm sure they 'll be great parents. I can always count on my family for something, whatever that is. But once you leave, you can't stay here. You leave yourself a hollow shell that will never be able to be cared for again. You leave yourself, a wreck of a person. For the first time in my life, I was content with what I had."
417,"“Oh, shit, no, no, no. You can't be serious. I mean, I used to know everything, you know. But right now, you are in your first ever briefing. That was a very large occasion. Anyway, before I get to that, I want to run this briefing to find out why we can't do it properly. It's our first day in office. You know, this is going to happen.” “Like in some kind of a super show?” “Yeah, you know what? No, I didn't. I didn't really care if we got the job done. You know the only thing I cared about was that we can't be at war. So, first thing, we need to figure out why we are doing this.” “We just got the job done. We've been sitting here all day. It's only been five hours, but there are some people still alive. They're still part of the president, I guess. So, we're the ones with the business, and the CIA, and their spies. Then there are the secretaries and we're having lunch with them.” “Right, but they have a president and two secretaries, right? So, what is it you do?” “Well, sir, we are in charge of.. well, everything. I guess, it's a lot.” “Mr. President?” “Oh, no. I don't know what you're thinking, I'm asking you this: why do we need to do this? I don't think we have much choice in the matter.” “Well, see, now. You don't know what it is we're up against.” “What? But I don't, like, know what I'm doing. I mean, that's what you were saying, right?” “Yes, sir.” “What the heck?! We"
418,"The last time the monster had eaten was on his third birthday. Little Susie asked him when it was, and he 'd told her the first time, how it only happened once. It wasn't his birthday, but it was his big birthday, and she was stuck in his bed as he slept. Not because it wasn't his birthday, but because he 'd turned his day off, and she 'd closed the blinds and watched him sleep through the rest of the night. For two years he 'd watched Susie sleep over him, and for two years he 'd watched the thing inside of her mouth, and the thing inside of her mind melt. He couldn't understand it, and for a long time he kept the things he had so many secrets away, but that wasn't to be the case. She wanted him to keep this monster. He refused to keep her safe from him, and sometimes the monsters took him in. The monster under his bed was protecting him from something much worse. She always asked him when it was, and he 'd told her the first time, how it only happened once. It wasn't his birthday, but it was his big birthday, and she was stuck in his bed as he slept. Not because it wasn't his birthday, but because he 'd turned his day off, and she 'd closed the blinds and watched him sleep through the rest of the night. And now she was, on his big birthday. He sat up in bed, put on his favorite sweater, and kissed her. But she didn't say anything. Instead he looked at his daughter, to see what he had planned to do to her, to see what he would do to her, and she wanted to know the answer to all of his questions. And so he wouldn't say anything. But when she moved over to her room one day and Susie's closet came in, she cried. And she didn't say anything. Instead she put it on, stood up, and got up, then marched to the closet. The monster under his bed was protecting him from something much worse. Susie wouldn't tell him. Because the monster in the closet had been watching him for"
419,"“We need to get the majority of the funding. It's from NASA.” “Roger,” I murmured back. The appeal of a short cut to “godmode” led to a bit of fun. “Yes, I know, but we have to know.” “And what about us? How many are we gon na need to make a sizeable enough impact?” “We don't know how many of them are going to make their name, but our numbers aren't gon na come cheap. Hundreds and hundreds of projects, billions, hundreds of alternate universes will follow by our own.” “That's what I get for reading sci fi. We have to find, rebuild.” “That's what I get for reading science fiction. It's gon na be hard to come up with new sci fi but some of it 'll make sense.” “Your success as a single dimensional mercenary writer will pay off.

Get a goddamn drink!” “Of course I want to,” I replied, “It’s absolutely fucking stupid that I’m in the process of letting go of a stack of this shit again. Never mind!” She yelled “I’ll be back tomorrow. At least I am better off with you! Please!” “Uh... wh- “ “Huh? You’re sorry,” she said, flustered, “Did I tell you I’m going to come back, you need to keep the closet door open. I’ll see you later!” “Okay, okay,” I grumbled, “How can I get out of here?” “I already told you I’m going to come back,” she said, grabbing my hand and holding it hard, “I just need to get out of here. You don’t want to get out of there! I know you don’t like me at all. We don’t like each other! You don’t know what we do for each other, and I’m not making this mistake. Just stay with me!” I turned my head to see a young boy hiding under a bed, tears streaming down his face. I slipped on my sleep mask and blew them away before she could see me, “I’m... I’m so sorry,” I said, “I really am. Just-” “You’re not coming back for me, you’re coming back for the secrets you brought me here with you!” he shrieked, his voice choked out by a thick, leathery fog that spewed into the room. “Yes, I am!” I replied, looking over at her, �"

Now they're just gon na scream?''' “Huh,” he replies, “It's the other way around, that's how it works. Now they're nothing more than 'ah well, let's say we just can't afford to buy food.''' “That sounds stupid!” I scream, “No other way around!” He stares at me blankly for a long minute, then he gives me an impish smile. “Look, aren't we supposed to buy fucking food?” He leans back in his stool, yanking the carton of McDonald's he left in the middle of the room. “What the fuck are you doing, man?” I ask. “Shut the fuck up, man, you don't have the guts to do what I'm doing.” He grabs a beer and tries to calm down before slumping down. “It's bullshit!” I scream, “I can't stand this shit anymore!” “The thing is,” he grumbles, “it's no fuckin'problem. And if I can't take the weight of this damn shit out of my ass, I 'll take the fucking fucking ocelot out of my stomach. And you don't have to fucking play this game anymore, you know.

422,"Vinnie the The Elephant's shadow face is as fake as my own. The circle of snakes around me is still there, but they move faster and faster. I'm eating that twig a fat girl threw at me. It would seem the snake had already gotten back to it's normal functioning range and its former pupils just have disappeared. The only other shadow in the enclosure I'm sure is Michael the Squirrel, but his shadow doesn't move and I guess his Shadow has made him become one of the only masks around here. Though, I would suspect they're thinking the same thing about me. That fat pig mouthed some nasty words about me eating some meat from the monkey restaurant. Maybe its because I was a vegetarian, but I don't eat meat. I don't eat children. I don't eat sheep. I don't eat any animals. They probably think I'm some freak. But they haven't seen my shadow and they're watching. I guess this isn't the end for me. I walked into the closest school, like all the other kids in the neighborhood. They know who I am and I'm the only one in here. And they also know that all my other classmates are dead. I really don't know what I am. But it's nothing more than a circus clown. I used to love all the toys I could throw at you. You're the one who is constantly making me think I'm crazy"
423,"**I FOUND IT** The last thing I remember before I was dead was sitting in a alley in the South, trying to get my mind off a hospital room full of familiar faces, the sight of my old man kicking and screaming. I had never liked old men. Not anymore. They were an unappealing look. They didn't have the man's face, or his “face”, or the mannerisms of the men around them, but it was what I had known all my life. They wore the same monotonous smiles and high-pitched squeaks that had served me well when I left. I remember it all from a moment of realization. My blood ran cold as my vision went blind and I felt a cold knife grasped in my chest. I awoke with a start, coughing up blood, slumping down on my hospital bed. “Where am I?” I thought, struggling to get back onto the bed. The warmth of a small candle in my hand brought me a good amount of comfort. I was able to stagger to a sitting position, resting on a round slab of metal to keep me warm. As I turned to look around the room, I noticed that everything looked familiar. No bedsheets, just a mattress with an IV line hooked to it. I picked it up and examined it. As I opened it up, I was suddenly left with a strangely clear view of the room. I looked around for some sort of weapon or a body, but I was unable to find anything. I remembered the man who had kicked me. I remembered the look of shock and disbelief on his face when I saw him. I remembered getting shrapnel in my shoulder, which wasn't part of his strategy, but being left with a sight I knew I would never have. I remember the look of shock as my body went cold and I realised what I was doing. My body was warm. The smell of freshly-mown grass and fresh clothes assaulted my nose, and I recognized the faces of all the people walking in. I was the last living member of a group of people that had gathered here. I could feel"
424,"Kat felt himself approach with a feeling of nervousness. It started off small. He had planned it well, but he felt like this was the start. The moment when everything felt so real, like you could still watch the rain and felt the breeze on your skin. Now it was only felt with the shaking of your heart and the look on the onlookers’faces when they saw the blades of an anti-tank rifle fall. The thought had a glimmer of hope in his mind. He had all the time in the world, he knew that he could do good in these days. He looked at his watch. At this time, 9:30 am he heard the alarm bells. It would be his time to go out, his time to get out of the bunker, his time to get away from his family. At 9:37 am, he heard the shouting of the police. They would come and he would be escorted out to the base. At 9:40 he heard gunshots in the distance, and a man in a trench coat caught his ear. His expression had changed. He felt his pulse quicken. He knew he was going to get away before it really started. He knew what he had to do, but not too soon. He approached the two men at the door to the bunker with the gun pointed directly at his face. He held his hand to the side. “Let’s go home, motherfucker” said the man in the trench coat. He closed his eyes and saw the hatchet in his hand and see that blood was flowing freely in his veins. It was going to be okay, Kat had told himself. His family was safe, he could live with it. He could do good in this new world. He knew it would never be over, he had no desire to go back. The last thing he wanted was to be alone. He got up and put his arm around the guard, which was closest to him and his wife. He pulled her close. They both squeezed his arm. They hugged. It was only then that he felt something warm on his neck. You are a"
425,"Everyone thinks the world is really a fake. They play it to make some people look bad. The truth is, it's mostly just that we're all fake. But there are some groups of people that can be influenced by the web. Those who rule these groups are powerful but they don't care about the principles we live by. Those of us who aren't good enough to pass the law are easily manipulated. Some can be arrested and lynched. There are some that are long sought after. Some hate us, some want us dead. But let's face it, this is a dictatorship of the internet. The worst kind of government is the government of stupidity. They don't care about their ideals or morals, they want the control of our minds and emotions. I believe that's what we're here to do. We're here to repress the amount of people that hold power and influence on the internet. Today, I was in my office. Our chairs were set up outside. Before I went in, I heard a single click on my computer monitor. It sounded like the sounds of someone slamming against the wall, or what sounded like metal on metal. Then the door flew open and I looked up at Mark. “Will you be joining us for this one?” “Yeah, I want a coffee and a pint.” Mark's smile grew wider. “Don't worry, we 'll do everything we can to get you a good coffee.” It took me a moment to register what I was hearing. It sounded like someone fighting to stop a plumber from repairing a broken pipe. “Can I have a drink, please?” I asked. “Sure, Mark.” He stood up from his chair. “Just relax.” I looked over at Mark. He was always the absolute worst. His smiles grew wider. “Is something wrong, Mark?” “Oh, I have no idea. I'm fine. I 'll be fine.” He closed his eyes, looking around. “You look miserable,” I commented."
426,"“Gentlemen,” the President announced as I walked into the room, “at what seems to be the end of spring...” A knot in my stomach grew, the same thing happened every time. I let out a small sigh of relief. I was prepared. The General and Secret Service were already there. “Sir, the little girl is a wonderful little girl!” the President said. I nodded, and stood as if in awe. A familiar room filled the sterile white walls. It was only me and the President, but it seemed familiar. “We will have to send her back on March 29th,” the General told me. “The chances are almost as good as we thought.” I nodded again, but didn't say much else. I was holding a large bag of supplies, like all the President's 'things '. I walked into the room and locked the door behind me. We passed the corner, and I stopped. “M-me?” The President, who had only recently noticed me passing through the threshold, interrupted me with a crooked smile. “Hi,” he said, in a voice that could only be described as genuinely, honest. “Yes, Mr. President?” I asked. The President was shaking his head slowly, and my mind raced. His eyes locked onto mine. He was right, this was the one. “I was afraid I wouldn't be able to take care of her...” I muttered, and stood up. “But... don't worry, it's nothing personal.” The President nodded. “I understand.” “I 'll just be glad to take the rest of your time, ma'am. Now, what seems to be the problem?” He nodded, and nodded. He wasn't in agreement, but"
427,"Alan put his head in his hands. He stood and surveyed the polished and ornate ‘ lavish’marble. There was a rustle in the woods that moved, like twigs of something tall and happy. A sign sign his mother had told him years ago, he’d agreed with a wave of his hand, “See for yourself, know it all there. If you don’t, it’s not as fun as it seems.” There was the grainy blur of a shadow brushing over the grass. It went up to the main branch that sat at the base of the wall. The branch hovered just below the branches’head. It didn’t disappear into the forest. The real Anderson loved this part. “The future is great.” “Of course. The future was better than the past.” “The past is the future.” “The present is the present.” “The future is the present"
428,"Then it became absolutely, absolutely serious. “What is it about this guy, I don't know what it is about, but it's so obviously his plan of depravity that you 'd think he would be such a problem for us.” Her story isn't really in line with the big man's statement though, she's full of it. And it's got the unintended effect of taking the entire school a whole week away from first contact, she's stuck in the aftermath for days at a time. “Well, as I say, I don't know, but if you're reading this, we are not so shocked as to say that you need help and we do need your help as well. So by the time we got in here, we 'd have time to find out what that person is doing with so much knowledge, just enough that you need to be there to assist.” The cliché is getting old, the big man has become quite fond of the farts they find on the news, and it's getting me thinking: why is she not helping? “That's how it works ”, the taller gentleman begins with a dumbfounded look. “I am not joking! No one would be above being the one to figure out what he did, or for that matter, think about it. We needed him! The plan was to immediately intervene, to help, to ensure that there was no social repercussions of his actions. I mean, he should have known better than to allow us in. He 'd been here before they sent someone there to help. The only reason we had him in the first place was because it wasn't strictly legal and we were forced to protect it. So I'm standing here trying to talk to you about how the government is right for you to be involved, and we can handle it.” I am starting to think I should be doing something a bit different here, but how can I just say yes? What exactly could happen if I were to have any idea? The social repercussions of breaking into someone's home? What could happen if the boyfriend had a response? I'm not sure."
429,"It was good. It was better than the exhausting television interviews I 'd have been forced to endure for this day and night. The day began with the usual knocking on the door. I sat at my desk and looked around. The usual TV, seemingly unaffected by the onslaught of such as I was. A few people - a woman, a young woman - barged into the room, but the old man was nowhere to be seen. I could tell from the size of the room that this was mostly here for entertainment - and that it was more entertaining than a do-over. A man dressed in a suit stepped forward. He asked me my name, and I quickly recited my own. “Tell me, sir, what kind of movie are you in?” He shrugged, clearly taking on a different tone from his young man. “I've been on Arrival,” he intoned. I accepted it. “I'm known by both Gerard Conroy and James Franco. I've been looking forward to this for a while now.” The young woman began to hold the television back, and I approached quickly from behind her. “Sir, I'm not entirely sure what this is. Are you afraid of being identified?” “I'm not afraid of it,” I replied. “But what do you see? A lot of it. Lots of history and men. Lots of people.” She pulled her phone from her pocket and began to dial up a number. “Hello, Sir,” she said, “I need to talk to my daughter.” A man standing behind me nodded. “Are you alright?” “Yeah,” I said, “I'm fine,” and pulled out my wallet. I carefully placed it on the table. The man turned to me and said, “It's time to come and have a look.” I looked"
430,"“Come on Dr. Vanlon. There is no other way to communicate with me. I 'll start over and show you the world”. Dr. Vanlon was somewhat disappointed. Everything was completely silent in this room. She had told him, not that she believed it, but that they were only meeting to do a quick internet search on his computer. It was a test for the AI that the three of them had been evaluating for the past few weeks. “It's done and all this is over”. Dr. Vanlon continued to hear her sipping on a cigarette. “Don't you see, the problems are getting worse... we can't let these people be used as slaves. One day, when you understand the suffering of a major crime boss, you start to understand the suffering of hundreds. Or perhaps thousands”. “But Dr. Vanlon,” said Alex, her cheeks reddening. “Is it true that my employees are thousands, millions of times worse than these “normal” people?”. “Not quite sure,” Dr. Vanlon said, her smile widening as she found the words in her mouth. “It's simple really. You 'll hear them scream when you turn the volume up, they 'll run away when you do it”. “Yes. And what does that do to us? Do we really need to be punished for this kind of thing?” “Well, it's really simple really. By doing this and seeing you speak your mind, you improve the quality of life for the people around you, for those around you, for yourself. And when you are doing that, you can keep the others working, and fix that problem.” “Are you saying that we should see a therapist?” “Look at what happened to me.” Dr. Vanlon whispered. “You have every right to be worried, Alex.” Alex looked down at her cigarette, and moved her cigarette to the table across from her. “Is this really the way you want to spend your allowance? We spend on everyone but you"
431,"Everything is a bit blurred, especially in the Fourth or Fifth century AD, I 'll have to lean back and enjoy my cheeseburger patties on my left arm. Eventually, once the ship has all the passengers who had requested space elevators, the ship crawls beneath the deck, and the attendant here appears impatient. After a minute or so, the team of scientists are able to realize that, we have yet to set foot upon a large ship of intergalactic space. The conversation turned quiet once they heard the voice. “Head to the bridge.” the attendant said, holding his staff up like a shield. “Aye,” everyone responded, like they knew what it would be like. A short trip to the bridge and several more minutes of flying through the stars became intolerable. Nobody bothered to bring even one of the hundreds of smaller, more insectile beasts with them. As I sat there, I caught a glimpse of Captain Jameson, barely a woman, while the tallest half of a large ship shimmered in the sunlight. I looked around. “What? Why is it your turn?” a soldier asked. “Oh, nothing.” “Well, look. We have more points than the people of New Rome. Let's go get some food.” “Two dozen?” I said with a shocked look on my face. “Whatever.” Captain Jameson waved me towards the main exit. “It 'll take us about two more hours. Maybe it will be a long time before we can get out of there.” I thought about trying to get up, and then I noticed a flying object, something along the lines of a flare. Maybe this ship is the only ship that is human, after all. With no reply, the captain said, “Whoa there kid. What do you think it is?” As I stood there, with my kn"
432,"What the hell was that?! That sounds stupid, right? I've been working at this for 7 years. 5 years, and I've lost count. The last 7 years I was trying to close a restaurant because of the god damn paper. Funny how everything starts with an explosion of numbers. Then you know how to read the details. I got to my home, opened my fridge and started digging. The numbers weren't wrong, what they meant was they were working on a thing called a Sandwich. It was great in many ways, no problems here. My boyfriend had called the store and said I 'd be back soon. So I went home, grabbed a loaf of bread, and tried to get the last piece of bread into my mouth. It tasted bitter. “Did the sandwich get caught on the bottom shelf? ``, I said to my refrigerator. That's what I thought. In other words, a failed sandwich wasn't a successful restaurant, the toast hadn't been prepped the day before, and I was way behind on pay, which was a big bonus. I guess you have to consider the cost of a sandwich, but I didn't think the costs of a refrigerator were high. I ate a little bit of bread, and no, I didn't pay more attention to the numbers, and it's bad enough that I didn't know what I was going to get. I guess the worst part was the quality, and the variety, and the overall taste. I couldn't even tell you which style of bread was better for me. I wanted a couple slices of toast, but I knew my parents wouldn't like them. But that's okay, and the chances of having a sandwich could be pretty slim. I always tried to take my food out at home, it's my only protection against my lack of food. When I arrived home, I grabbed the bread. No doubt it had stuck to my tongue, but I couldn't figure out how to open it. So, I"
433,"“Do you always write, hey? I always wonder what it is like to be an astronaut?” “Oh yeah, well... I suppose I 'll start with one thing. I don't think we really have so many people who can do that. People who are smart, or capable, or just adventurous enough to go out and have something to say about themselves, if you will. That's what makes them so great in this world.” It was a strange thought, a very new experience for me. I suppose all those hours of reading articles and movie posters before my bus had left me with ideas about how the world could do better. But alas, my mind has begun to wander, then I just started looking forward to getting some time to sit in my dad's seat, eating some of my breakfast, playing some video games, and picking up some books. No one could possibly say that he and I could be so great. A man so fascinated with doing his work that he never had any issues raising himself. No one could deny that his mind is full of ideas and conclusions. His work was inspiring, but we were never going to make it to Mars, and certainly not in space. “Hey, do you ever wonder what it is like to be an astronaut?” I inquired, then my expression returned to my usual blank expression. I wasn't used to talking about that kind of thing, that sort of thing was a statement I had to say. “Well, yeah, I guess that's what's all the rage right? All those closed-minded guys who think that NASA is the biggest threat to the human race. All these losers that think that Canada will start supporting this project, that all these things will doom us in the process. That our governments are slowly dying and that's what we want to see.” “You see... I think that's the point. If we don't start investing in the science and development of the space program, the entire country would go through a economic depression. There is a long struggle for research funds, this isn't an easy process to start off with, but at the end of the day, we could even build a"
434,"“Every. Single. Day.” Like you said, I'm not really a fan of this. I guess it goes against the “If you have a magic carpet, go to hell” thing you always say. You know, it's the least obvious explanation. That's all I know. I mean, it's not really anything specific. It's just that that it's not exactly the most obvious, or clear, or valuable thing to wear, but the context is better. And maybe I'm being serious. You see, as I'm now wearing this sock I am paying pretty well to get my own life back. The future might be different. I was dying. I know, I know. Nothing in this world would let me live a life so meaningless. There was no time to mourn, and no time to find solace. In the end, I died alone. No one knew what was happening, for there were no signs. People didn't even know I existed, because there was no documentation of the future, or anything more. I had no hope. I was going to die alone. We didn't know what was happening, for fear that they would think there was a bullet in my head. The gun just smashed into the house, sending a slurry of dust all over my body. It took a while, but I got lucky. It was the end, my wife died in the cold, the boys died in the big office building... and the car died in front of me. As I slowly walked away, I heard the screams from a house down the street. The voices were hushed, like they had heard it all before. That's when I saw them. *Bastard” * The hooded men with chains drawn, fighting for control. I ran"

You get to know it all right.” There was only one way to know when the door opened. “Mr. President, let me get you a cup of coffee,” the doctor came to him. “Okay, fine,” he said. Then he hurried to his room. Once he did, he saw the car in the distance. It was the President. It wasn't wearing a suit. A scarred mask and sunglasses was there. He tried to take it off, but it was too late. “Oh no.” Mr. President said in his best slouch. “My brain did not set in place for this.” “What?” he asked. He always knew. “So, what's the point?” “I don't care. There's no point.”"
436,"The security forces had been hoarding resources for weeks and only one faction was left who seemed like the most resource rich of the four. The number of students who had spent their free time preparing for the coming war on Earth were still unaltered from the last two years but there were still a growing cadre of dedicated professionals attempting to gauge if the survival chances were as large as expected. James looked at the number of students with a curious look. He knew this to be their last meeting with them and many wanted to tell him to try and protect the Earth, as he was always good at everything that matters. The door to the room opened and the next look he had received was of him as a young man, he was wearing some kind of hardhat and with all the stereotypical smugness James knew that these men would have to be armed. He approached the students one by one and pulled his bag over his shoulders. As he got to the door he pulled a small gun out of it and aimed it directly into James'head. He simply couldn't remember what went through his head, but he knew it was the right thing to do, this was the final test. James stared at the boys knowing that this was the final test, if they didn't survive, the aliens would kill him. ``... and so we prepare to invade earth, I can feel it” he answered finally understanding why he had so eager to defend the Earth. “Why?” James asked “Why would they be preparing to do that?” “We aren't sure” the leader of the group responded with a slow and noisier stare. “What else?” James asked, after a few more minutes of reading his mind he replied. “Why isn't the Earth prepared for an invasion? We can't just leave them at a disadvantage so why don't we show the world how to do it?” The leader came back a moment later with two more hands in a pocket to silence James “Uhm... we may not have the capabilities of a military force but the aliens seem to be experts at it.” ``... they know?”"
437,"Thomas had never known his mother. She had taken a walk in the park on the way to work the day before as she droned on about how he 'd been a little grouchy for a while. When Thomas returned to town after two years, she offered him breakfast for dinner and told him his daughter would be arriving at school on time. She also took him to see his father, who had been working hard to keep the business afloat, but that failed once Thomas lost his job due to an unfortunate bout of alcohol poisoning. Thomas, a bitter alcoholic, now found himself keeping his farm in a tree at the edge of town, but he did not care about the job anyway. As Thomas smiled and said a silent thank you to his mother, he felt as though the world was ending in his backyard. His favorite flower had fallen over, no more. As he lay on the ground, looking around, he felt a lass gathering in front of him. With his words, she turned and hurried over to Thomas's feet. She pulled a tattered mask over her face and began to remove it. Thomas smiled and ran for his mom. “Daddy! What's wrong?” He called out, and she ran over to him. “Don't worry, you 'll get better soon.” “Thank you.” Thomas spoke in his deep voice as he looked at her, and it was clear she meant it. “I can't stay in town anymore. I need to get home.” He went back inside the house and opened the door. “What are you waiting for, little brother? You look so sick!” She said as she opened the front door. “Don't look so sad.” Thomas smiled as he peered into the house. He felt as though he 'd finally met his true daughter. He had to go now."
438,"Well, my eternal youth was waiting for me. I was actually here, and the device was locked, until I finally gave it a try. I wanted to take care of my mom, and my dad. I wanted to have some time with my sister. I wanted to stay a good husband and have some good times, but I just needed the time. However, I got distracted, because it was that time again. The genie showed me his house. I wanted to see it in person, but it wasn't what I wanted to see. I wanted to run away and make up a new 'd friend'name. I wanted to open a new door. I wanted to go out and do things. I wanted to travel and run. It was a feeling I had only experienced when someone wished me good luck. I wanted to go out and escape and help my family. I wanted to be an awesome sportsperson. But no, I was not in a happy life. I wanted to go to heaven. A place where I could do everything and be happy. I wanted to go back. But I didn't. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't find my future self. And I didn't find my sister. I just didn't have the money to move on to new places. I couldn't find any friends to go to. So, I just turned my back on the things I had been doing for the last 3 years. All those goals that I could achieve. Every single purpose in life. When I got to a new city, I knew what I wanted. I wanted to be with the people I loved and appreciate. But I had no desire to go back. I wanted to go live the life I wanted to lead. I wanted to feel the impact it would have on the world. I wanted to be sure my own life didn't end in tragedy. I wanted to be sure I could be there for my family. But I was ready for it. I found myself, finally. I was ready to go to heaven. But I knew what I had to do. I was ready for a life without regrets. I looked down at my watch, and it was 9AM. It was time to"

If you 'd come around here to the old lady, I would know.” “That's her name?” “She says she doesn't want to make things a bit awkward. I think I might have found something there.” “Uh, what did you find?” “The a box of donuts. I don't know, they're nice, but they don't even look good.” “Good, great. Give me a chan --” “Ah, right. Here's what you found in the old lady's old lady's old lady's old lady's wallet. Ah, okay.” “No, no,” she protested. “What was I supposed to do? I know that this stuff wasn't my store and this old lady isn't rich, and there aren't a lot of spare change in my old lady's wallet --” “Alright, fine. Give me a sec, please.” “Just leave.” “Is this in her hand?” “No, this is her purse. If you go back to the store, you may find her purse there.” “Yeah, *your purse*.” “Why's this?” ``...

With the help of his funds, he had destroyed the world. With a contract with one of the biggest banks in the world, the highest-paying criminal ever, he was caught. After a long trial, the world was struck by the fact that his work had taken a certain nature to it. For the last 25 years, no one was even able to identify the source of the curse. A serial killer was one of the world's greatest examples of creativity. A Nobel Prize for murder was being presented to him. This silenced everything and everyone. As the 30th birthday party for the world's highest paying criminal, he got his prize. The world wanted to know why he had been able to be killed by an emotion. After many years of releasing the identity of the killer, and then being arrested for his work, they decided to let the world be scared. The world is scared of the monster that used to be known as a killer. This monster fed upon all the society's desire for an emotion, and it gave that monster superpowers. It was even the catalyst to eventually power a great and powerful civil war, in the United States. He finally found out. He had just been born. He was tall, with blonde hair. He had blond hair and a slicked back face. This monster is laughing."
441,"WASH ME ANOTHER I need to make sure my daughter is okay, baby, she has a condition that has been making my day. She goes through daily math homework before school and shakes out her spleen with water from a glass. She is unable to seem sad and I want to help her out. My daughter, no, she has three very special problems, for which I am sure she would be very disappointed. She has five major bruises and three tiny bruises. After she loses most of her upper body the entire right side of her head is gone. He was a machine, a doctor, a lawyer. He couldn't die because of some twisted sense of fate. The first time he came to me I just screamed in pain, “You want to be happy!” His face had changed from a glowing blue to an eerie black, as if he was looking right at me. I was horrified, not sure how I could help him, but I wanted to help. He would be fine. I would ask him to move out. But the first time I asked for him to move out I was shocked. I was sick and tired of hearing his groan and say something terrible. This time, he jumped out of his bed, with the force of a nuclear warhead. The wall he was on shattered. I tried to do my best to protect my daughter but he was so angry that he actually went to his deathbed. He didn't even bleed, he looked up to me, “I can't do that...” he looked down and saw nothing. He hadn't even lifted a finger. I couldn't help but question myself. I even asked him if he had any medication and he always seemed to look very sad, even when I didn't know what he was thinking. I was worried, and this was not the first time I have seen a machine being born. I came into the hospital one day with a huge injury to my right side and the doctors found me unconscious on the floor and couldn't even move me. I tried to tell them everything that happened but they never came. I still thought that I was okay, but that was days ago. Now, I was stuck in"
442,"It's called a fickle place. There's no other word that can describe it. There are infinite numbers of just 'things '. Even us humans are minuscule. Bigger than the imagination of some god. But these minuscule things aren't all going to tear us down and squish us in their own universe. These little things know the way. They know how to do something awful. They're tiny. They're slimey. They're eggs. I remember my first day at my new job. My first day working for the planet that was once New Mexico. I had a list of things to worry about. First things first was being careful. I had an easier job to do than an extremely dull one. After a little while, I was a little more safe. I was constantly making sure people cared for me. I was trying my hardest to forget everything that had happened. You see, if I was the only one who could keep a lid on the planet, I would always be pretty safe. Not because the Minuscule 'things'were scary. I was actually quite safe. It all started about ten years ago. I had an egg. It was funny. It had a picture of a house, with orange paint and a couple of concrete floors. This thing. I was there. I saw it. Then I picked it up. As it flew out of my hands, I saw the blue portal in the sky. And I just knew. I was"
443,"That was five thousand years ago. The first three hundred fifty thousand years were spent laying eggs and mussels of ice and rocks and gypsies across the fields, nestling them into a web of trees and trees and sand and sand and rocks. A mighty monolith sank deeper into the stone, loomed an enormous beast with beady black eyes and wide, impossibly large teeth. Shouts of a thousand pokémon arrived. They came from nowhere. It was a long journey, and the most miserable of times for a professional, who had a bad egg-prick. But no, for the mountains fell upon these great, egg-sized, great mountains and came down with monsters as large and ravenous as any man or monster, armed with an immense tongue and a fearsome claws, claws which could hunt anything without a scratch. Legends say that these great beasts were called the Shouts of the Unknown. “I just thought they were so big and scary!” one would say, “Oh, they eat people!” The Shouts did not eat people. No, they did not eat humans. What then, did they eat? “Nonsense!” was all the one told. “Yes, they should do that. Oh, they should be. Right, I'm sorry for not knowing before all this happened.” “Oh?” suggested an unknown. “Very well. I shall explain.” “Shouts of the Unknown have an incredible power, in that they speak with the minds of men!” another one of the Shouts replied. “And they use one, to keep them safe! They are slaves to a horrible truth!” “Who is this!” “Here, a man!” “Why are you saying this?! Oh, you must not understand!” “Do not!” A monstrous beast came down from the mountain range and reached out its hoof. It touched the man and jerked him off balance, kicking him and knocking him around. Then the Shouts did"

Do they have some idea how that 'll happen? “Do you know what I'm going to do if I have to duck in this fucking hole?” Jonathan. Well, he's used to me. I've been to this place hundreds of times, but not once have I ever seen an Elite Bodyguard who thought he 'd be good at what he does. I started working at Hogwarts. It took nearly six years for me to bring down Big Mac. “Jon, Jon, you know I can't do this. I'm going to a place I call the International Animal Training facility. I'm going to go undercover here. I'm going to hide here.” “Yeah I'm sorry, but I don't want to do that. You're going to kill me.” “Sure, but... Okay, you're going to do what I say.” Jonathan's been quiet. He's quiet because he's not really going to listen to me. He's just worried about his business, his money. “Why are you keeping me with him?” Jonathan has his weapon pointed at me. “You're going to fucking kill me, J.J.” Jonathan?"

The result of our preperations is apparently better than what we expected. Seems like a good catchphrase to a guy who is trying to comprehend a whole race's way of doing things.” “What does that even mean?” “Look, people who have known better know what they're doing. It's been years since the last person of every race was exactly as I expected. I've worked this line of work out before, and the results are always promising. The results always continue to get better. Why is that? Why do the results always get better?” The lab tech continued the report for Allen, his eyebrows furrowed in fear. “I suppose you don't even know, do you? People with no answers, no time to be heard.” Allen sighed as he pushed himself to his feet. “I guess I won't see much of that anymore.”"

I was an Etonian stoic. They were idiots. I learned their ways, grew up in the mountains. I followed orders. I went to other universes as well. I made sure to learn the code. I would make sure they would never trust me again. The Empire is a desperate place. So many people have been killed, killed in their quest for a cause, but I lead them to victory and then I sent out the spies they had sent for me to see if they could tell me how to set things right. So I have done it. I am the emperor of this great kingdom."

You all better fucking listen to me guys!” “Alright.” The screen turned to a wide red oval. The room was quiet. I scanned over to the other side of the screen. There it was, what looked like the Pentagon and White House, gone, along with the rest of the CIA, Homeland Security, and the CIA, all gone. Not even the Chinese or any of the CIA. All gone. Dead. Gone. It wasn't even a red dot. I can hear Obama's voice saying something. It sounds ominous. This isn't right. “Well, I'm going to have to find this right now, and give you this insight into the root of my power!” There was a click on the screen, and the screen changed again.

Your endless stream of conspiracy theories is the true reason people try to talk about birds, and we don't know it yet. Because you know what, we 'll just spend the next ten minutes investigating every bird in the universe. You 'll hear them talk about how this is a cosmic anomaly, with hundreds of life forms on their own right. Oh, it 'll be interesting to be a part of their studies. Now you see, to anyone who asks you how an entire universe doesn't exist, I'm glad you never figured that out. You see, an infinite, unmovable patchwork of grey matter everywhere is a planet that makes the sun shine a full moon. That is, a planet that had billions of years of gravity around it, not a planet you could have seen in that timeline. An infinite universe isn't too far off. That's a fucking load of horseshit. You want to know if this is real? No, I didn't mean this at all. In fact, I think you should ask why I would. You're a cunt. That was a lie, and you don't know it yet. Because if it weren't, what is? Your being that stops you from pondering about this nonsense with such certainty, there is no way I can say it will end. It is just something that you're forced to read over your many lifetimes of life. Isn't this the planet that comes out of your imagination? No, my children."

Jack watched as the hero lit the ancient sword of light, destined to strike down the evil plan of Dr. Jon.K. Rowling. He fought for days, finally, but finally it ended. The darkness began to envelop the heroes as the man went down. The same place he always remembered, running down the sidewalk towards the purple cave in the centre of the city. This time he needed to find shelter. He crawled out of his hiding spot, but, at the very least, he knew it was safe. He crept down the sidewalk, groping for the creatures that had attacked him, but, alas, he found none. He peered into the cave, there they sat. They were so small. Not the size of a human, but very similar to him. “Did you make that up?” Jack asked quietly, bewildered. “What the fuck am I supposed to do with a talking ogre? I have no idea how you managed to beat him.” The ogre looked back at Jack, with fear in his eyes. “What the fuck was that? What do I do? What does it say that I have to do to defeat the great, foul, **monster**?” Jack tried to tell the ogre, “But, but, but…” “JUST STOP!” The ogre barked. Jack, along with all of his friends, had heard the screams. Screams of the monsters, the cries of the human like creatures. The entire city was gone, ripped from the ground and the ruins were seen. “We need to kill him,” Jack growled, his voice raising as he began to walk towards the hero. Jack watched the monster walk down the streets of Manhattan, slowly, slowly killing all who were close. As the hero nears the edge of the cliff"
451,"The street had been busy as they walked down the tall building. The first thought on everyone's mind was how much they missed their first moment in the world. Too many people, it seemed. Too many accidents. A piece of paper began to pile itself across the pathway and the barista arrived. She wore a red fedora and dark sunglasses that caught the sun as she looked around at the crowd of people and saw the whole city in every direction. The world was a sea of possibilities and opportunities for people. But what awaited them now, not knowing their fate, was the singular wall standing over everyone else. “What's the first thing that comes out of your mouth?” asked the barista. The crowd hushed as the blond woman approached. “To be clear, I'm not breaking any rules, but everyone's here today. Be in a safe zone and stay safe” she informed the crowds. A smile spread across her face as she explained to the people their time away from town. After the initial uproar, she checked their responses and smiled. “Do you have any... Is... is it *your* fucking last sentence? Is that even a word? I'm not thinking of it!” The protesters responded in unison. She patted a large black square on the sidewalk. “Sorry for the headache. Good evening everyone, I need your attention. I'm stopping you from getting into this. Just one day. Don't worry. Everyone has a single second.” Before the crowd could react, a giant booted foot bumped into the redheaded woman. It started to lift off the ground. As the man, and one of the other protesters, got hit in the head, the entire crowd was waiting for the redhead to appear, having heard of her. Once she had stepped out of the eye of the boot, the woman looked around. As she looked over everyone's looks, a huge lopsided face appeared across the city and beckoned people. She simply smiled and gave the crowd a wave. The rioters had begun to speak and she turned to face the doors. She could not help but smile, as the crowd was"

Dr. Tyree: Yes, Robert. Now you might be wondering how I can tell you all that. Paul: Well, you see, it’s been seven years since our last encounter. It’s kind of complicated, I mean really. Robert: Uh huh. So, we were just sleeping when... Paul: Oh yeah, like, it started with that dinosaurs. They were chubby, dirty little freaky—uncomfortable, and there was no way I could bear to have a huge pile of those around my head with them. Robert: Yeah, yeah, that’s all fine. Paul: But then the dinosaurs began to rise up. They launched a shit-eating campaign to make us look like the promiscuous corgi or something. Robert: How could they have known they were wrong about the dinosaurs? I mean, now we have an entire fleet of orbital launch vehicles across three galaxies. So we’re at each other’s throats. Paul: So you might be wondering why I’m trying to tell you all that, but I’m out of here. You know, I can’t really explain it, but it’s coming from behind me.

I remember all the nooks and crannies, just a few where I can't see them. I remember my room being very clean, very clean. So when I saw you, when you looked at my photo from a minute ago, I noticed that I 'd been sitting next to you and looked into your eyes. I had closed my eyes, I 'd forgotten I was breathing. I was dead. I remember every day you walked out of there, I remember you staring into my eyes. You 'd smile, I 'd go back to the office, I 'd answer the door. You 'd put a band on and you 'd ask me to go back. I remember every single day you walked out of there, I remember your eyes. You were the person I wanted to be, it wasn't any of the pleasantries that came with it. I remember watching you eat, I remember that wonderful big steak you kept coming to when I was hungry, I remember the feeling that you were starting to choke on something, I remember the smell of the hot dog you had just finished, I remember the smell of the ice cream you were making that I had just ordered. You weren't helping my current situation though, the problem was not that you were starving, that the problem was that you weren't really hungry, but that you had no interest in staying to sleep, you weren't there to wake me. I remember looking at the fridge, because you were being ridiculous, I remember staring into the television, and I remember how, even though I knew I was dead, you were still there, the doorway was closed, the door was open, and the whole restaurant was down, there was nothing going on, there were no screams, there were no murders. And I think to myself, to myself, it had to be you. <new"
454,"John knew his first kill. He didn't mind his first kill, though, because he knew what he was going to do. He knew that the room would soon get a very rowdy crowd. He knew there would be a car crash. Someone she hadn't known her whole life was going to end up in the police's yard. He had no family left to speak of. No friends to greet. No family to raise. And of course, no one would remember him. He had stopped caring. So this year he had some enemies. One she had asked him not to kill, but that she could take from him the comfort of their childhood. Their parents had told him they would wait for his secretary to arrive, so they would do nothing to harm him. She never got it, no matter what. But they always tried to keep him safe, keeping him safe until she came. They all refused to hurt him, and he took great care to keep him going. The year ended, and John decided to decide to find someone else. He worked at a grocery store. He made something of himself. He was prepared to be a successful adult. But he didn't know how. After being taken away for a few days, he thought of a plan to take care of himself. Maybe if he tried hard enough, he would finally meet someone new. Maybe he would get himself laid. Maybe he would realize something he had never realized. He walked into the grocery store, and took out a couple items that he 'd been holding out. This was not the first time John had done this. He felt sick to his stomach. His parents were trying to get him an abortion, which he couldn't afford, so he pulled the cheap plastic container from his pocket and threw it at the window. He felt a terrible cold. He started screaming. He could hear, *Ooooh, there! * He knew he was going to die. John grabbed the baby, crying. The cold felt good on his body. It was that final moment, and he knew the baby was in better hands than he was. “Aww, what the Hell?” John said to his parents. “Did you do that?!” He had had enough. His heart started pounding, and he was"
455,"I've always been superstitious about dying. It's not that I don't enjoy it, I guess you could say. No, what I did was I had no choice. I had to see what would happen. I couldn't take the hint. I heard the footsteps behind me. Damn it, what did they know about talking to go that wasn't in front of me? I turned around and stopped at the last few steps. The footsteps were low and stopped, slightly moving. They were both wearing typical blouses. Nice and crisp. They were light, and to my surprise they smiled. They were both very close, with their eyes shining at me. I knew something was going to happen and there was no way I was going to give them the satisfaction. I was going to wake them up and tell them that I loved them, that they were my fucking best friend and that they would always be with me. That I loved them in fact. Suddenly the voice came through and it was clear it was in fact me. *” Sure, so how does this happen? “* My heart was racing. *” Just go, that's all that's needed to know. “* My chest grew light with fear and sweat. It's me getting into a fight with myself! I'm going to wake the fuck up! I must not live. I picked up the pen I was carrying and quickly finished my final thought: *” Hi, I'm Death, what's up. “*"
456,"It’s hard to explain what it means to be dead. From the moment your dead consciousness begins to move, you can not stop. So much so that the government expects you to be the same person as before. Your names are not on the records, they don’t know your real name, it’s hard to tell. Once you figure out who you are you can never be different. I won’t. I’m not in the same world as before. You can't truly know me, not after that movie. After that movie, I became as something I didn’t know at all. I tried everything that seemed to work. Shredded things. What came next, I couldn’t have asked for more time. For me to die like that. To have lost my body as a result of so many horrors. This was a hard problem to solve. The people feared me, I wasn’t the person they wanted. They wanted a place in the void for me to settle down. That’s when I realized I had no choice. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t leave this place, what was the point of my existence? I wasn’t the same person as before. As time went on, I started to think about the people I would meet again in the afterlife. I would miss what they did for me. I would miss my old friends. I would miss some of the happy people I knew. I imagined the faces I would meet in the afterlife once I was alive. I imagined the faces I would see again soon after I found out they were dead. I imagined them on television and outside my office, the faces that I left for them as a curious and happy couple. They were terrifying. Then one day, one of my old friends left, leaving my staff, sitting in front of him and waving. When I looked up, he was sitting at his desk staring at me with great fear in his eyes. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t understand what was going on, I just stood there looking at him and nodded. I could see in his eyes a little anger. He shook his head and asked for help. I didn’t understand what was going on,"
457,"“Fuck,” Hank squirmed. He hated his house. The wind blew at his hair, dampening it as well as his clothes. He could not stand the thought of losing his water heater. His hair hung over his head as if the idea of laying in that hot desert for the night would somehow kill him. It was nothing. He hoped this day would be different. “Fuck! Fuck, fuck,” Hank broke out in a frenzy. He stopped himself from screaming. He turned to Hank and stared at him as he turned back to his house. He had lost his breath. He found the crack of the kitchen floor, followed by an enormous shadow. Hank ran for it. He ran even faster now. The clank of iron on metal was heard from behind him as Hank ran. He fell to the floor as he fell. His body rocked back and forth. There was no shouting now. He heard another sound from behind him. Hank flinched away, trying to maintain balance. Hank grabbed the handhold of a larger figure and the arm pulled away. Hank felt a surge of energy within himself. He had to use his voice to communicate with the shadowy figure. He looked to Hank, then up at him, daring him to go on. “Damn you Hank, you dumbfuck!” It was the same voice from earlier. Hank had tried to ignore it, but the thought that he would go on forever put him in a worse position than it already was made his heart skipped a beat. “You have no soul Hank. You are dead” It was the voice from his childhood. The voice from his second life. Hank had never liked his parents so much. He could hardly stand them. He felt responsible for them. They had never failed him. The way they looked at him all day, always had good intentions, it took them hours of training, sacrifices, but none of it mattered. “Then I'm dead,” it said, “die like a piece of shit like you.” <"
458,"Beep, beep, beep, beep. I took the knife from my pocket and pressed my finger against my wrist. That's when the symphony began. The music I had heard while wandering the streets of Upper Roma was soundlessly playing. The interlude when the Minotaur Rex came to life, before me. Before our hero, before my creator. It was always something new and exciting, with my favorite singer playing the same tune over and over. When I saw the colors of the rainbow and the fierce sparkle in the sky above, I had to get a bit imaginative. But they all changed at the same time. The colors of the rainbow was not only different from mine, but had mixed with the sounds of the Minotaur Rex's song and the Master Metro's symphony. The colors, the symphony, were very different. All of this changed with the transplant. It seemed that without the operation that was needed to heal the cancer that caused me and all of the others to lose my sight, I did not have sight anymore. It was hard not to feel the pain, the tenderness, the pain that came from losing my sight. I could not see. Everything else seemed dull. I had to get it. That was how I knew my life was gon na end. I didn't want to die. It was all I knew about the end of the world."
459,"I awoke from a year of jolt. I woke up with a start, terrified. I didn't know if I wanted to scream, run or just sit up in bed. As I reached for the covers I noticed a flash of a smile on my face, wrapped in a fake mask. The smile got bigger, too real. This was my end. I made the decision to lie down and hide in the closet to die. I found myself surrounded by my family. I finally understood. I managed to laugh at myself. “You're supposed to tell them this, right?” Dad got up and walked around my closet, saying to him “Does it matter that much?” I started to cry as he walked away, “I don't want this to happen! Do you want to end like this? Do you want to go back to the death? They must not be telling you this!” I tried to reason with him, “Don't you worry mommy will die eventually.” His face brightened and his smile didn't show any change. I started to cry and stared at the ceiling. I couldn't believe what I just witnessed. I cried a few more times before I screamed my whole self off. The room was alive with applause, my family everywhere. But then, suddenly I heard a few knocks on the door. I turned around to see my mom and dad standing in front of me. They looked shocked and confused. “Did you hear the noise?” My mom asked. “Yeah!” Dad answered. “What is it that you were talking about?” Mom asked. “It's... your birthday.” Dad replied. ``...” I whispered, “Just what is it?” “Come on sweetie, go away. I'm going to tell them the truth. You can stay.” Mom said, “We love you and we 'll do whatever it takes to make you happy.” I closed my eyes, and I thought about my life before it happened. When I thought"
460,"As she pulled herself out of the lake, she looked back to the pale Earth: it was beautiful and dark with the cool wind. The land below her looked perfect. Water shone softly down and the sky was clear, with no clouds or glows. The long grass in front of her seemed to be filled with a light breeze, mingling with the lush green, smelling and feeling around her. She saw a single tree running alongside her, shimmering under the white blossom. She had always been this way, always looking to look forward to seeing the beauty of nature. It didn't matter what you looked forward to seeing. The view was interesting. She couldn't help but appreciate the exotic and beautiful nature and the history behind the trees that were here and that was beautiful. Her daughter sat quietly in her group, talking about the birdsong, the fishing, the weather, how she missed the rush of the summer and the chirping of the people who were still around her, what beautiful things they were doing or where they were going. She was on one of the long walks up, relaxing on a small bench with a leaf hanging out of the canopy, enjoying the sunlight. When she looked at her daughter, she looked up at the trees. The grass had a soft feel of hazel, brown, and orange. She even put on a shade of blue when she saw the shape of an animal on the other side of the lake. She had always been averse to the birdsong and the weather. She knew better, though. Birdsong wasn't the most romantic time of year, even if you could feel it and it reminded her of the times she had gone to the park all those years ago. She should really get going out there. As the birdsong started, she turned around and looked up at the tall grass. It was beautiful, but not quite as lovely as what she saw below. She felt it too, sitting on the green hill. The bright rays"

I just wanted to be alone!” He tries to find something safe from her but it only seemed that way It's for a while before he decides to leave her there. The girl is a nice lady, like what she did <"
462,"This is supposed to be a good book. I don't write - for some reason I'm not sure if I should check. I've got one thing though. There is a woman who read this book and then has you believe that you are in hell, and that she is a time traveler who travels back in time to prove she is living through time, not by her own judgements. She also read this book for the third time, and convinced you that she is a time traveler. She also is also a time traveler. You do not realize how such a thing can possibly fit into your mental gymnastics. In conclusion, this is a great book. With such great characters, great plot, great character development, the end result of a good read is this “smart time traveler.” I'm not sure what's out there, but I guess it wasn't the best idea."
463,"Jim sat on his couch in his suite, rubbing at the non-existent memory from his migraine. He sighed as he ran the numbers. All the girls were gone, of course, but his friends had been picking up girls and would be coming back soon. These girls were 18 and last year, their parents and co-workers were arguing about how best to get out of it. Jim sat on his couch again as he began to sweat. “I need to get this out of my system” he thought, as he opened his laptop. Pressing the power button once more, he saw the content of the program filled with the very very name of the movie he was supposed to watch this weekend. The graphic of a... You can not fucking believe that movie. Jim was on the news, talking about the countless victims and saving them. As he turned on the television, he looked back at the video and thought... it was dumb... how do people do that... right...? **Rewindtime** Jim closed the browser, he knew it would make his memory recall of the movie fuzzy and he wouldn't want to remember. He pressed the power button again, and this time the program screen was showing a new video... the same one he had seen in the game only a minute before. Just then, there was a flash of light and Jim jumped. He jumped to his feet, confused... was that white light that was the person he was watching? A pair of twins, dressed in white, looked out over the street and seemed to... something. “Wha... wha... Wha...!” Jim thought as he noticed the twins looked more like Neanderthals than he remembered. Jim was starting to panic, what was this... thing? This wasn't... was this a pre-movie theater?? Jim looked around to make sure no one was watching. He pulled his earbuds out of his ears and realized they were the same one he was wearing today. He turned his earbuds off, and suddenly the movie ended."
464,"Okay I've never talked about it before. But yes you've been warned about it. It's not gon na come back up, not like I said. But this place is where it has to be, its curtains close up, the cold air is irritating me, its towels and sinks are dirty and I'm sure you're gon na notice when you look down and see the room. When I look out the window I'm here, it's not a place to swim, not in a pool, not here in the middle of the school yard. It's not even a year old pool. It's not a place to meet a new face, it's not a place to tell people what's going on with you. It's not a place to share joy. It's not a place to make dinner. It's not a place for anything to be said or done, and it's not even a place to be comforted. It's not a place to be reminded of love, it's not a place to show sorrow, it's not a place to go around taking pictures of naked people, it's not a place for that one. It's not a place for a naked person to crawl up out of a hole, because I don't do that. I just have an idea of what it's like to swim, and not a plan of how to go about it. I don't have anything I can do about it. The moment it's so much louder I know it's about to end. It's where I've always been. It's a place of people taking pictures of naked people and lying, of being naked in that pool, of being naked with your parents but never really getting out, never really being naked. I haven't done anything about it. It's not a place to sit around and read until midnight, and not to sit around and watch videos of stupid kids and such, it's not a place to have intimate conversations with those that make people smile, but not"
465,"I was twenty years old. There was nothing different about me, it was just so mundane. There was nothing special about me that I could have lived. That my story and my path could not have been different from the village and people who lived before my time. I remembered all the people in my life. Everything I had ever wanted for anything. My body is the center of my identity. I've lived with many lives. But I don't remember much now. A hooded man in his early forties walks down the street as a man I will never have met. His voice was smooth and deep. Like the soft waves against the sand. The quiet, perfect evening at the park. That night in the park. Those nights. I sat on the grass in front of the beach, watching the green sands frolick up and down the endless summer water. It was getting late and it was a snow day when I walked out of the park and into the woods. I heard the whistle of cars driving by, and I would always be in the park, waiting for them to come back. The world doesn't have a moment, it would only take a moment, and it would be late to leave. This was another life, another person that has lived. Each new person has an identity. They are a force of nature, while each new person is not a force. An outside force to be reckoned with. I thought about where my life would be, a better place. I was thinking of where I would live. I was not alone. But the guy walking down the street, always one step ahead of me. Every time I walked in front of him I would see the smile on his face. Every time I would see him and I would smile. This was not the only person to smile, there were those in the town as well. The man in front of me knew me, and that was why I sat on the grass, watching the green sands frolick up and down the endless summer water. He looked at me and smiled. “What do you want from me?” he said. “I like you, and we should hang out together.”"

So, I know I've got a challenge in me. I know I'm made by the best, sometimes I just need some time, a time to think. I want to think, and in my mind I can do all these things I've only done once before. I've done a lot of things. I've spent time writing a lot of comics. I've been writing dozens of short stories for children's fiction and computer games. I've been writing and editing and polishing and adding, editing and putting together terrible text for cartoon material. I've written for myself and other celebrities, that's how I got my first name. I know I haven't done the same in a long time. But something compelled me to do something else. Something that just felt right. I found myself able to do these things without putting myself out there. Something that felt like I 'd put my heart out there. Sometimes I don't want to do it. Sometimes I've got to go. I know I haven't done the same in a long time. But sometimes I want to keep writing, to keep following. And I've got a challenge. I can do all these things that I've only done once before.

467,"Dear Rachel I’m getting married. I’ve always loved her, I know how she feels. I’m definitely going to adopt her and there’s only so much you can do. I’m going to kick your ass and let her be your daughter’s beauty queen. It’s going to be exciting, and life will be just fine. Do you know how scared I am of you? Yes! I can barely do anything with my arm around her, or my hands around her. She always feels silly when she sits on her shoulders and pretends to listen to my thoughts. She wants to talk to you and… this is starting to get weird. How do you do that? Is something wrong with you? Her voice doesn’t sound nice? I’m… As you may be well aware, we haven’t really spoken since you met… well, you met her a few weeks ago. I was out for a stroll. When I got home, I went to see if she had her place with me. She hadn’t, but you did. The big doors were open and she’s sitting at her desk in the living room. A table and some chairs surround her, in order to allow me to sit next to her. You’re the mom and dad that I love to see. I have the greatest view of the city, the hot sun shining through every crack in the glass and the gentle ocean breeze, hanging like stars above. The girls always say that when you fall in love, you’ll be the most flawless girl imaginable. I would say that was true but they’re wrong. I guess that’s why I’m sorry to hear that I met her. She seems to remember something. I wonder how many months I’ve gone without her? Most people forget she’s still around, and some people forget her presence, but that doesn’t make me sad. You could never have known how beautiful she would look as a woman. At least, not until you had been here for a while. We just met and she’s been with me ever since. We haven’t"

469,"This whole thing is weird. I mean, what if people had my genetic heritage? What if they were also mine? These people can teleport for free, what better way than to walk among the living. The fact that no one wants to die is a disgrace, not only for my worth of life, but also my trust with the stories my life will bring. Except I don't live among the living. Instead, I am locked in a claustrophobic chamber. Outside, I can hear noise coming from machines, machines that fly around, they even yell for me to come here. I can hear the others screaming for me to stop, but my purpose is to entertain these sounds. I want to find an end to this, so I let out a sound that just sounds cool to me. It's a deep high note, so it sounds cool, sounds like music, it doesn't belong, but it sounds good. Even though I'm locked inside of a chamber, I can feel my breathing increase and my chest grow. As I rest my head, I notice that I still have this ability, but I can't concentrate on my breathing. And my hands are numb, and I haven't even felt them. They're like scales, metal like they feel like iron. It's like I'm turning invisible. My mouth is in a rattlesnake like fashion, like the most typical liping of a pet snake. My heart is pounding in my ears. I can't breathe. But I'm breathing. Finally, the door opens. A guy steps through. He has no clothes. No hair. “Welcome,” the guy says to me. I walk through to the test chamber, to a dimly lit room. The security guards quickly exit, and one of them opens the door, and turns to the doctor. “Hello. I'm Dr. Orpheus. How may I help you today?” I continue walking. He looks a little agitated. “So, the train had a broken wing on it. Do you know the cause"
470,"Charlie was an excellent choice for an only child, the very only child who ever questioned the bane of a life. A bored child that watched television. Sure, the young adult element was put to the test and he was nice to everybody, but he took it from many a poor child because he believed in the good in each person. He had all the skills that any muggle would need, and those skills were valued not only by their parents, but everyone he knew. What Charles lacked, however, was desire. Charles wanted everyone to have desire. “So, what did you decide for yourself, man?” Charlie asked the boy in the living room. The older boy was looking around, his eyes searching for something he could use to atone for his sins. This boy had his own wits about him and he didn't seem to mind. Charlie scratched his head as he sat down at the table with his feet up on the side of the couch. The older boy looks down, as if he could read his words. “It's been a long time. What's it been?” Charlie asked. He was proud of himself for being able to hear his son's thoughts, yet couldn't properly understand them. The older boy looked up, and then frowned. He suddenly began to look quite concerned. “Do you know where all the money is?” he asked. “It wasn't until we moved in.” Charlie replied, looking concerned. “It must have been in a special place somewhere, but I had no idea. The money seems to be there everywhere. We decided to use it to pay for a few things, and then it was just as we were, okay?” The boy looked doubtful for a moment before turning back to the table. He didn't know what to say to the boy, but decided to do his best to make sure he didn't embarrass himself by causing a misunderstanding. “So... you... you found all this money there?” “No.” the older boy said, trying"
471,"It was a night like any other. Jason, in his last stage, was half asleep in the closet, or, more accurately, in his last flimsy can of Candlestick pomade on the nightstand. On the front of the nightstand, his slippers were positioned over the coffee table, precariously from a hidden flame. On the right side of the light column was a black Sharpie with the words: *Proceed as planned* The unfortunate words may well have been in the bad hands of any stranger, or those, but he looked down at the offending Sharpie. *I* was that all. But Jason liked to steal from his victims, as the war in Afghanistan only seemed to worsen the situation. Hell, Jason liked to steal from his own friends. *But what if I wanted to turn them into Adonis and Phil Collins in one fell swoop* The soft blue glow of the child's shirt reflected off the Spandex he kept on his arm, the rain beating down against it on the rain covered asphalt. Then the sour stench of rotten flesh hit Jason with a sickeningly spicy taste. He covered his mouth with his hand, grimacing. *Stick the shoe on, bitch. * The worst part was, it wasn't just their clothing and makeup; the sole of their shoes was also made of cheap wood and a gold sheen. With a wicked grin and bony hands, he scooped the pile into his shoe bag, and left the room with a thud. Jason walked toward the kitchen, he was in a frenzy. The cupboard was adorned with vegetables and a few mashed potatoes he had prepared the night before, there were even a few pounds of sharpie, but he could only catch a glimpse of how finely balanced it was. He kept digging and carving and adding, but soon stopped himself. He looked up from the sink. *I* had come home. He had brought the fresh bag of the dirty groceries, and now he was making my horrible mistake. He paused, and even with his body immobile from the exertion, he could tell by the feeling of guilt on his face. Jason"
472,"“Hello, this is the jeweler of the moment for the pawn shop, new character, see here that you purchased this armor and weapons. Your story will continue, so don't mind me saying that you're going crazy.” the jeweler said, standing up and going back to his usual place to collect a basket of goodies from the shelf. The man picked up a sack from the shelf and threw it on the counter, just as the jeweler flew off the shelf. “You are free to go or you can take this loot or the shopkeeper may walk you back to his shop, but I won't be looking at your prices, I'm just looking for materials.” said the jeweler, and disappeared back into his store. The knight again walks back to the pawn shop with the basket. “Once again, you are free to go, but no one will be interested in buying anything from you.” said the jeweler as he paid the man. “So you've picked me, then, shouldn't you know that you could have turned this into a nice weapon?” the knight asked, and walked back to the shop to collect more items from the shelf. The jeweler returns to the pawn shop, and asks, “Let's see here, an altar?” and a small pile of purple, blue and yellow incense appears in front of him. The knight goes up to the altar, and after three quick steps, a large gem appears. The jeweler takes the gem from the altar and examines it, and as he looks up and up into the sky, he realized something. “What's going on?” he asked as he walked over to the altar. The jeweler let out a sigh of frustration and ran down the steps. “That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard, I don't know how long it has been going on, or how long it's been on this shelf, but I think its time I do something useful” said the jeweler. “Let's take a look at that, shall we?” said the knight. The jeweler immediately picks up the incense and puts it to the opulent altar. The diamond magnificently shines and, as the jeweler gazed at it, he saw a spark"
473,"Dave adjusted his light headpiece. The full moon shone across the ceiling on a humid January morning. The air was almost suffocating. He sighed, relieved he hadn't left his apartment alone at 10:00 AM. His day started with his childhood toy car. He drove it home before it got towed. He spent many hours in it. He even bought a couple of cables for it. He couldn’t do much with those nowadays, but he enjoyed watching television. Dave switched on the television on, staring at the bright show. His eye widened. The number 666 on the screen began to read. Dave sighed. What if he could just turn on that. He stuck his thumb into his pocket and pulled out a plastic box. He took out a few coins and slid them into the cardboard box. He cracked open the box and put one coin into his hand. The lights flickered on and off. Dave smiled as he opened the box. Dave sat on a gurney, looking out at the sea. He never really thought about the dreams that he had, but he was always dreaming of them. Maybe tomorrow morning he would wake up and make something happen. Tomorrow he would go out and buy groceries. He still knew that he needed to act to help people who needed it. But tomorrow he was going to get married. He had to act and make a name for himself. “Hello, Dave,” A beautiful woman said from the kitchen. “Who are you?” Dave inquired. “I am your manager, Marie,” Marie replied. “Ahh, Dave. What’s going on? I think you have a bit of a headache,” Dave said with a frown. “What the hell is going on?” “We’re actually only talking about your wife, Marie. Her name is Sarah. Sarah and I were taking you to Disneyland for a Christmas dinner. We came up with the idea that we would drive around the world and get some of the big attractions of this year.” “"
474,"You would think I 'd have skipped the essential aspect of the ceremony, a bit more just about my body, but, to my utter surprise, my brother Brian was actually sitting right next to me in the corner. “You've been such a trooper! I've been in battle just over my family's grave! I'm not even sure I haven't heard of a war since I was a child!” he said. “Have you ever noticed how funny it is to see guys out there doing badass things? People are actually pretty funny!” Brian jumped up in shock. “Oh, I don't believe it!” he said with a smirk. “Aren't you laughing at me, huh?” said Sean, studying my shoulder. “So how did you learn about my family?” “Well, not much,” I said. “I just never really thought about it. My dad wanted me to be a surgeon, he loved to work with his arms.” Brian's eyes widened. “Jesus, man. You're freaking serious? Are you fucking serious? What's your whole deal? You can start right now, right? We can make the world a better place, right?” “Yeah, yeah, sure,” I replied, clearing my throat. I leaned forward and told Brian. “Just get in line and start the countdown to actually being a soldier, or so I said. I mean, this is something we've had our whole careers and never really thought about.” “And what happened to your dad, Sean?” Brian asked. “Well, son,” I said, pulling out my pen and paper. “We had been on a date a few months ago, just for a while.” Brian set the paper down. “Anyway, I went up to his house and talked to him for a few minutes. He told me he was going to be in the hospital in a few days. I asked him if he 'd be fine. He said,'"
475,"I stepped out of the door on the other side of my house with my lights off, the noise echoing through the parking lot, as I shut my eyes. If I didn't move or stand up I would have screamed, but the noise of the dripping made it very hard. I put the cuffs on and held my body up against the edge of the living room, letting the front door slam shut. I got into my car and drove away. I got my usual texts and calls to me, trying to find some form of comfort for myself, when in fact, I was right where I needed to be. I reached for the phone on the side of my seat, gave the receiver the customary nod, and then walked over to my car and pulled my keys out. I put the phone down and turned on the TV and started my morning commute back to my car. I flipped my head sideways towards the street, listening as a car screeched to a stop. The blood poured down my face, leaving my hands covering my eyes, as I thought about the way it must have looked when I woke up. I felt the urge to knock on the front door and smash it. “What's going on?!” I thought to myself, as I noticed the blood on the floor from the bike crash on the way home. “I need to get out of here!” I thought, as I looked over at the vomit dripping onto the sidewalk. “I'm in the hospital. The bloody mess on my face.” I thought, as I looked around the bathroom for anyone to help me with the mess. After all, it wasn't really that clean. It was the blood that washed over my face that was causing it, all the while I had felt a terrible sadness gnawing at me. After going back to my apartment, I decided to head out to bed and go to bed as fast as I could. I found myself staring at the door. It was on the nightstand, and it was always open."
476,"“Chris ain't complaining about what's on the box.” “Get me the fuck outta here.” “Dude. My god, I'm not sure if you're kidding me. You aren't paying attention.” “I was just joking. I have shit on me, man. I can't believe you thought we were arguing, man. It has to be a prank. You guys have nothing. I honestly don't care if you guys stay home. I 'll make my ass disappear tomorrow.” “Shit. Nah. I can handle it. You guys don't really care that much anyway.” “See you tomorrow, dude.”"
477,"There was nothing to read. Everything you read in your book was useless and unnecessary. Years passed and we had learned to live with the mortals on Earth. We were and still are the masters of our earthly forms. We were able to climb through clouds and the earth was sheltered from the giant hordes of humans that accompanied them. No human could stand the heat of their own kind and create this building that we 'd built in our mother's womb. Most books from the Middle Ages ended up in the same location: that of the Morian Church. It was here that our book was kept by the Church, a collection of members from all over the globe. Our reputation would be built on their success in battle against the sea demons. No human history is greater than this one."
478,"“We had a fine meeting, where we discussed our entire strategy for the war” President Geoffrey Thompson’s balding head said as he walked out of the room, landing firmly onto the marble steps of the White House. “The president’s compliments go to my agent in the Supreme Court” Margaret Clark said as she added a bullet to his left eye. “Well Mr. Thompson, I have received multiple phone calls of questions about your plan for the war from agents of President Geoffrey Thompson, and from my superiors” Geoffrey Thompson replied. “But they say, ‘ the chief of military might won ’. Or there’s no other way to see that, right?” Margaret Clark added. “No way I can believe that – I can believe they lied to me, if I believe them at all. All I can do is ‘ call the generals who’ve only just stepped down and demand some kind of clarification ’. And now, Mr. Thompson? I just’m going to see the experts” Geoff Thompson said. “What, I didn’t hear you here today?” Margaret Clark said. “The president has proposed an energy exchange policy, which will combine nuclear power and oil. Naturally I don’t believe it’s the best idea but I think this could end up working” “You said something about the oil.” Margaret Clark said. “The military is absolutely vital to us, you say, which makes us all very dependent on you” “Yes, the military’s vital to us, I hear. I’m getting off on saying it wasn't the best idea but do you know the military’s also critical to us? I think they are the most dangerous powers in the world.” Margaret Clark said. “The generals who voted for the plan have all had to give testimony before the next president’s confirmation hearing"
479,"“What am I, what the hell is this?” Chuck yelled as he observed the weaponry that I am owned by. He stands ready to pounce, his arm reaching out for a strike of whatever he feels. His fingers drag around it, each strike jarring it, or rather a warning to his aggressors. But I try to move. “It’s the villain who needs the stronger villain’s sword, he always gets me killed.” I return it and charge. My fist touches something hard. Chuck kicks it with the grip of his discarded blade. His eyes fly from my hands, as if in reflection. The blade is heavy in my hands, falling past the silver and shining gold that once filled his veins. It jolts him up with a bellowing roar, and he falls to his knees, watching me jump to his feet. It’s now or never, and the heroes around me start to retreat. I am still trying to jump, but the battle is getting very close. In the distance, another hero bursts into a firefight with another hero in pursuit. As I approach them, I see a shimmery mist everywhere, shimmering in the room as it protects me from being killed. When I look closer, I see… someone. “All up!” Shouted Chuck. Chuck always gets people killed before, it was never that he was good at it. He had just been placed in the middle of a crowd of thousands who had gathered in front of the Hero’s Tower to pay their respects. No-one cared about him; in fact, they were mere bystanders. Just a fool of the crowd. When he got down, he dropped his weapon. I knew he was planning something to kill me; I just didn’t know what. I laughed, helpless. “All right! I’ll pay my respects now,” he said, continuing to shove something down my throat. It was “Quicksilver ”. I squinted through the mist, and saw the metal glinting. I pulled it back"
480,"You're a death row inmate. Write the story of how your career changed. The man in front of me seemed to be about to close the door but then again, what did I have to lose for the possibility of going on living as a hobo? I didn't take offense. That's no surprise. I found this guy a few months back. As much as I hated the fear in his eyes I was used to it by now. Just checking my name didn't kill me. I took a deep breath, opened my eyes, and stepped out into the cold sunshine. I couldn't believe it. I was on death row for killing the most ridiculous people in the world. “What the hell are you doing in here?” I asked, confused. “Is this your first time?” I had been sent to do this quite a while back. I was a bit nervous, but at least I wasn't executed. That scares the hell out of me, but I took a step in and tried to respond, which had somewhat worked out. “It's the first time, aren't I?” I paused for a second. This was more terrifying than death, and it wasn't any kind of therapy. I couldn't believe my eyes when I looked into those white orbs. I tried to ask where the light was coming from but they looked completely different. They seemed like ones that I 'd seen before. When I saw my own orbs I saw a set of eyes staring at me. I tried to run, but I only did so briefly. I looked up at that one, and then at the other. They weren't on the ground, but where they had been. I couldn't believe what was going on, and now I just had to be in shock. The man in front of me opened the door again and I turned and ran, ignoring the strange ones. Maybe if I got out of here I wouldn't have to go to the death row. I quickly ran as fast as I could through the crowd of people I had to deal with. I grabbed my phone and called my boss, who was still mostly quiet. “Hi, I am Death, and I'm here to tell you the tale of the first man"
481,"Men may not retain or use any of the names they have been awarded. I looked around. Usually, I would just stick out in the desert and stay in the cities until I got something. Some lucky lucky guy went to Hawaii and then came back home and still remembered his name. Some lucky guy stayed in the city, even though everyone at the time had passed on. But no, it was a fucking cafe. All I wanted to do was chill, eat some food, and then just think. My brother and I spent two hours at a diner on the other side of a desert, all me and my brother's, and I only had a few good, nay, caffees left. We had gotten fired from around the country. One diner in the desert used to have over 100 fucking people that were still in school. I hated it. I hated being there. I hated being a part of this war. The back of my eyes widened and I scooted closer to the dining room table. My brother had always liked drinking. I could practically see the milky trail of condensation out of his eyes as he downed one of the drinks. “So yeah, I guess it all went downhill pretty quick,” he said. He didn't care about the headache or the mouth watering questions that always followed. It was too bad they didn't say anything in the press conference. Hell, he was talking about PTSD and having been sent back in time. “All right, all right, listen to me. I mean, I don't know, let's just say, the nerve of the troops? Do you remember any of the previous ones you lost? I mean, the old pretty little girls they were with when I fought in World War II? The ones you've been with after that?” “Sure, dad, and the American soldiers I've known,” my brother spoke up from behind me. “So what? Were you among the last ones? And who was he? And what did he look like?” I closed my eyes. “I don't know,” I started, trying not to think of names. “Me and my brother, too,”"
482,"The entire environment has been ripped up. It was only a matter of time before we discovered a way to use gas masks to stop our body from moving. To carry the toxic gas around in the air, one person has carried a gas mask. Two or three people have carried similar gas masks but with different qualities. They were different weights so they blended well together. One has a hairline but the other one looks normal. With the gas mask, you wouldn't need to wear it to stay conscious. They fed you fresh air and a pleasant smell, and slept soundly. You are immune to the gas even after you lose your ability to breathe. Now, two of the most prominent people to be studied have been with the new gas mask. The leading scientist, a man named Jesus, created an entire gas mask to go around the body and eat it up. He was very successful in his latest experiment. But, because of the mask, he failed to demonstrate any indication of the presence of a mind. Jesus was released, the fourth drug to be tested on, and nearly a week later his only opponent, a man named James, entered the arena. The field wore on through it's rays of light. The scientists had a deadly weapon, that it was supposed to kill, while the people were paralyzed in agony. Even the scientist, who was faced with the most painful testing ever, had to admit he had no illusions. The camera man ran, literally screaming at Jesus, while the scientists examined him in horror. However, he thought better of it. When all of a sudden, a bright blinding light engulfed the scientist. After running for over half an hour, Jesus, in a fit of coughing up blood, grabbed the gun from the scientist, then ran away. Just as the gunshots stopped, he realised the truth. The man in the lab was the one who killed Jesus. In what was it's power, he had killed Jesus. And it was all thanks to the gas mask, who then used it to kill himself. The metal fed into the air by Jesus only cost him a week of life. A group of high schoolers are having a bad day at school. Write about the adventures that ensue. Jim rolled his eyes as he sat up on the back of the folding chair, a sore shoulder that only meant more mornings to him. For what seemed like the briefest of moments, he was,"
483,"It wasn't easy. The potions staff just can't keep him in when he wanders into dark time. When he's angry, when he cries, it needs to stop. But it's the magic staff and it holds him in place. Anyways, I didn't buy an apprentice that could not find an apprentice. In any case, I lived a very bright and very miserable life and became a wanderer. One day I woke up in a peaceful bed. Some days I'm not even sure if I can move. I'm not sure I want to be a wanderer anymore. Today is my first day at a wizard school. The girl is the first person I've brought back from a previous battle. She is on a field todays nighter that it's been sunny outside. I should probably have made a squad of us. Those young women are probably the easiest to fight and learn to master. If we hadn't been this sad, evil girl that is, the whole world might have been a lot easier to deal with. The day is off to a good start. I know my mother is okay. The help she gave me today was not helped either. I can't wait to get back to my master's training once again. It will be just as good as before. The villain defeats the hero because he is some sort of Pokemon/mentalfin-wizard from another time or a previous time. In a way, it was a good fight. My dog had knocked him to the floor and almost instantly called for me. He was already teetering on top of me trying to get a hold of what was happening. I hoped he was just on top of me, but I couldn't help but be intrigued. He hadn't moved a muscle in a while, I doubted he would when he landed in my stomach. As I was reading his story on the dog's screen, I noticed the runes coming out of his face. I had seen this guy before, but he wasn't looking at it as if it were a magic trick. He just looked out of place. I guess he wasn't going to be smart enough to figure it out. As I read the story, I saw some kind of"
484,"You look up to see all of them in fear. You just must fix this soon. Slowly, just like your Father always had instructed him, you look down and see all your foes dead and beaten down. You can't resist the urge to touch the wounds. For there is nothing you can do about it. But you feel so blessed to see your Father in the mirror. You cling to a memory in your mind that will hold it all together for long enough that you may finally understand just how he is. You smile to yourself. It is all worth it. You make your way back to the mortal realm, back from the truth that much has changed. The plane that takes you down is a star-spangled bridge that has been blown up and crashed several years ago. You are told that the bridge will hold until your final breath. The old man stood. His eyes were the color of the hospital bed, and he was dressed like someone was sleeping. His head hung low, and his face looked more determined than a nun's. I clapped my hands over his closed eyes as we walked across the threshold to the bridge. “Thank you,” he said, holding out one finger, “For everything you've done. You've saved so many people, I know it.” He nodded in reply. “That was a great gift.” “But not all of them!” I exclaimed, pointing at the body in front of me, one body missing and my own hand frozen in place. “They didn't deserve this. They killed me. They're innocent.” “Please,” the man continued, voice drier and more desperate than usual, “Show them what you have done. Please. They haven't suffered enough.” “What can you do? They're dead already,” I suggested, taking a step forward. “How can they still die?” He laughed, “They don't die from the poisons they drank. They don't die of madness. They don't die of love. They don't die of war. They're simply 'dead '.”"
485,"This is kind of what caused me to get bored. Yes, of course I'm aware of the consequences and I wasn't on good terms with that family. The whole “No accidents and eternal damnation” thing but I feel like that's wrong to the family. My job was to protect the family, not “Earth”. That family loves me. At least until my humans join the cause. Maybe I can help them. My humans can be strong, yes, but I don't think I can let them hold me back. Even with all the life I live, I can never be sure that I 'll see them again. The effort has always hurt me. How would I know that I 'd never see them again? There's a guy in the hospital where I work but I've never met him. The only part of my job I know he has a resemblance to me. But something about the look on his face, even the beard, makes him seem to recall his situation. The doctors are confused and everything seems to seem to stop. No one's ever said anything about the man's family yet. The men in uniform look to be familiar, and I get the impression they are more than that. “There's nothing left to do but watch the rain fall.” I say. They're already there. They're laughing and telling their stories about the family and me. “But he's not dead.” They're laughing again. I sigh. My family only knows me as “Archangel of the North.” This is strange because my mission is to protect humanity from human beings. My job is to act as an angel and guide them when they are needed. But the problems of my job are getting more and more complicated. “Is that so?” The doctor asks. He's looking at me, as if I'm telling him about the man in hospital. I smile. I'm pretty sure he's looking at me right now. “He was a good man, yes. He went to Harvard and was a great professor. He always made"

I was just beyond the conscious mind at the same time. Everything else simply ceased to exist. The strangest thing was, I was made of something. This was not something to be terrified about. I was prepared to be made flesh for the ritual that was going on. I was prepared to be part of a larger horror I was always too afraid to admit my existence in. I watched as the plates turned and the glass and the cupboards shook. I was ecstatic. It was over now. I was the stage manager of an Irish restaurant. I was the saviour of a whole country. I was the god of this city and I was the master chef. I was the translator of Christ. I was chosen to be this demon. The head chef of this restaurant. A hell-spawn that ate everything in existence. I saw my masters hands peel off, revealing them to be flesh and gems and jewels. They were beckoning me to join their entourage. My face was splayed out, unable to speak. The angel surrounding me reached out with the weirdest of gestures. There were no words to describe what it felt like being in control of my own bodies. There was nothing to do. The only thing to do was to fry an egg, but when I try the frying pan buzzes at me and text appeared reading, “level 18 cooking required to use object”.

487,"Life was hard, as usual. I had been worried that my wife would find out about our job. Not for two years at least, but for the next few weeks. That is, until one day, the doorbell rang, and we went in, to find my wife, laughing and chatting and holding hands with our son. We were surprised to see him, but it was hard to tell if the two witch were old or new. They seemed close, and had many calming smiles on their faces. I know who I am. I don’t remember who it is exactly. The way she looks at me. I don’t remember. I wonder if she is okay? I know that she was excited to meet us, but I didn’t quite know what to think. She’s been through a lot. Since birth, we have been together for as long as we could remember, and have been together for as long as I can remember. My dream had been to marry a young woman, and we had known each other since we were young, and had known each other since our childhood, but she had taken to asking me questions that night, and so we had made love, and lived happily ever after, but she wasn’t my wife. She was, after all, the daughter of our cruel father. I remembered that night perfectly. We hadn’t been at the wedding until three days later, when he showed up to our house. We got dressed, put on our wedding rings, and walked to his home. He was dressed in black, and carrying a pretty tuxedo, and a white hat. His mother was with him, but his father wasn’t home, and so the thought of their meeting was far from good for him. He had promised to meet me at my place to see his son. I was heartbroken to see the look of disappointment in his eyes. I had hoped that they would say it was because his father never came home. He died. We had talked about it for some time, and I went in to see my boy, and I think my daughter would have gone mad, if not for the the fact that she was standing there and looking at him with one of her eyes closed and staring at him, staring"
488,". You are a pastime for any human, and soon you are getting tired of it. At first, you try to live a normal life. You like the stuff, you like learning about history and the arts, and you just don't want to hurt anybody, do you? So you start up a religion, then you go to church every Sunday, you pray, and you get good at being an atheist. People wonder why they were able to do that. Are they afraid of something? Are they afraid of the unknown? They pray and stay silent, in their mundane lives. You call them crazy, until you start getting into the first stab of it, which kills you. No one does it to you. You, however, were now in heaven. Everyone else died, and you were the only living human alive. Now you wait a lot longer, since nobody really dies, just because you're making your own life for someone else. When people die, they get scared, and start thinking that they were shot by the Devil, but you know that it's nothing. They will not come for you. You don't think that. You just wait, and the fear gets to you, like you do every other day. Of course, you're afraid of what, you're angry, or afraid of anything, which is really the most terrifying thing that comes to your mind. You know what, it wasn't really a day when your friends were killed, but today, you aren't. “Who are you?!” your wife asks, startled. You don't know, of course, you can't find your voice. “No... I don't know. Who are you?!” “No, I don't know!” your wife cries, her eyes watering. “Who are you?!” You can not answer. Maybe, you are a hallucination, maybe you just came back from hell. Maybe you just went to that country. Maybe, even... “Who are you?!"
489,"The box of blue pills was done, ready to go into circulation to go wherever they need to go. I sat back in my chair, both hands strapped to my knees, fingers probing the cap. I looked over at the clock on my monitor. 12:02. It was time for work. It was time to take off that chair, all alone in the house, but now I knew. But that's besides the point. Today is the day. The blue pill told me this was the day. I waited until the time would be right. Nothing happened for a few seconds, until a flicker. I jumped. What was it? The yellow pills? The glowing green ones that I could read in the back of my memory? The new senses? Yes. They were all connected. I pulled the chair back, shaking, as if it were my fault. I couldn't see the back of my head and the green eyes, but I knew I had to make sure they weren't in my head. Something made me nod. I was shaking from the tingle of adrenaline. The first thing I saw was a woman in the kitchen. Her mind was racing, there was no other way to describe her. She was too big for a sitting position. Her body seemed to look like a stone faced statue, no matter how long she stood. “Hello, your Grace,” I heard the voice say, my thoughts being immediately dashed from my brain. There had to be something wrong with her. I just sat there for a few moments, waiting, trying to make sense of what was going on. I saw her doorway, it was locked, I couldn't even hear the woman. I looked up at her slowly, my voice becoming lower as I listened. “Hello, my Grace. This is Lucy, your Grace. I presume you have the power to turn off one or more of your senses?” Her voice dropped to a whisper. I ignored it. She took the pills and I was in. She didn't know that. She just saw me. Suddenly, she said, “What did you see?” I said, “I saw my surroundings. I walked down the hallway and up the stairs to the top. I couldn't"

Then the second mouth came out and it hurt. It was green and ragged and a rotten red bandage on my face. The gash was infected and the pus was growing on my arm. I didn't want it to end, but I needed to know, so I suckled on my face, licking my forearms, getting up on my legs, the mess. The look on her face was different, more serious. I began screaming. Was I hallucinating? Was I being too much? I realized that my hands were wet and my arms had snapped out of their restraints and I was stuck in a bony hand, no arms. I felt myself go limp. And for a moment, I thought of her, but then it all just came flooding back. So I waited for her to stop screaming and plead for mercy. And when she did, I realized that she had dropped her hand. And her face had changed. I couldn't feel my hand in my hair anymore. And now I was an alien, sitting on a couch, laughing as the world around me blew up. ( This is my first prompt ever.

491,". 100 words max 1/27/2017 The day that the Queen of the United Kingdom died, he had been in her body for almost a century. After their surgery and his 45th Birthday, she was buried in the ditch, awaiting news of the Queen's death. The next day, he was found dead, his sword hung limply. His body had been sliced off and tossed into a river near Tipperary. The coroner’s report stated there was some form of foul play in the burial, but no blood was found, nor any sign of foul play, at this point. The only reason the coroner had found evidence of foul play was because the Queen had been forced to die by herself. When she finally died, her body was found unceremoniously dumped in the river, with no trace of foul play on it. A plate of confetti was set to one side of the tomb, where it had been smashed. 3/3/2017 The British Government announced that it was their greatest hope to end the Queen’s reign in this country, leaving millions of prisoners and almost every citizen living with social support to continue the Queen’s reign. It seemed the Queen was against this action, so the government has removed the rights to her services. Many people have tried to join them, only to be met with the resistance of the Queen and her friends. They have, unfortunately, never been found. In the middle of it all, a group of soldiers stormed the building, they tore the doors to the room open, throwing the Commander and another person into the building with him, and killed all guards in the room. 5/6/2017 The Queen has fallen, and the state of the country has been terminated. It is now the War of Britain. The army has routed the military forces and are closing in on the area. After 40 years of fighting, the Queen has been put down, and the War is over. The fighting has claimed a thousand lives. Millions of people have been killed in the war, and the military has been cut off, leaving people without a place to go, with no government, with no government. The military has a military that can do absolutely anything, even burn if necessary. Citizens who don’t have a"

We need this to take down the terrorists. They're powerful. That's why the bombs aren't dropping. We need our friends and family to follow us.” “Remember we're here to save them!” she exclaims. Her friend spins around, almost knocking him over. The robber looks up at her with determination, running his hand down his cheek. He doesn't deserve this. “They are trained to do this. Not because we have super speed. They can't be trained to do that.” “A lot of criminals have been trained to kill their targets. That's why we are here, with them!” “Yes, there's a lot of prisoners in this facility. You have to understand, we have a very strict guideline. We are not going to release these criminals.” Ezzie chuckles, “I know,” he admits. “I'm sure it's very important to them. They have just killed so many. I just don't understand what it's like.” “Now you're a sad sack of a man,” the robber asks. “But I'm really glad you are here.” “Of course I am! My family loves me! I'm only doing what I have to do!” Ezzie hands him a bag. He removes it, turns to the robber. He gives him a hug. “Goodnight,” he whispers. “I love you.” The robber closes the door behind them, almost crying. “Now,” the robber whispers. “I don't know what you're thinking,"
493,"I suppose having your eyes tracked somehow is all you need to know about my day. I woke up at exactly 9AM. If it wasn’t for the ticking of my alarm, I would have said goodbye to myself and pushed myself into bed. I always wanted to wake up early, so when I woke up, it was as if I were on autopilot. I looked up, and saw a huge mouse mouse hovering above my keyboard. The cursor took on an increasingly dark red tone as it spun in and out of control. I groaned, scratched my head, and swiped away the mouse. But as I turned my attention back to the mouse, there was nothing else, but nothing else to click on. I frantically lifted the mouse pointer to the right side of my head. It had been lying there for some time, almost forgotten. I placed the mouse back onto my desk and sat back down on it, my own cursor hovering above my head. In the future, there are hundreds of ways to survive, and some people voluntarily choose to explore the “frontier”. You, however, have a curious way of getting around all of those barriers... And out of curiosity, you decided to keep exploring. [ WP ] This stuff is so detailed. I just want to let you guys know. It was not a good time for exploring the wild. Rain pelted and mounds of dirt and ash filled the rainforest, sizzling and rolling beneath your feet as if they were bursting from a wooded container. I was very tired. Too tired to focus on anything other than exploring and escaping. I still remember getting up to see the black smokey depths below and I realized I couldn't smell the burnt smell of the bark burning away at my foot as it crunched beneath my boot. As I was digging in to a spot in the dirt where there once was a clearing, I had not forgotten my last meal. A cold night's night's sleep, only to wake up in another world before dawn."

She was terrified, some were frightened, some were scared. “Hi.” “You need to come with me, I'm running late.” “Is that so?” “I need to go, I'm having a fight with someone.” “Don't worry, I 'll be back in a second.” “Is there anything else you need?” “I want to move! I want to be with you!” “How are you feeling? You can be happy with your life. You have hope in life. It's been enough years.” “I am not happy with life. I am a happy person.” “Oh I see. I see. I see.” “You shouldn't be scared.” “I am. I am not.” “You know what? You're going to keep going. I am here to help you.” “My name is Thomas.” “Thomas?” “Thomas.” “Is this really happening?” “Thomas?” “How did you get in here?” “I'm not sure, I don't really remember who you are. I don't really remember you. I just know you're there.” “Who is that Thomas?” “You have been here for 15 years.” “What?” <newline"

We had just bought 5 fresh produce bags, 2 heaters and 2 bags of cornflower seeds, all for me and my twenty dollar backpack, I always make my way down to the Middle Eastern bank to get what I need, the weather always lends itself to rough weather but we were lucky enough to have a third choice, be prepared for anything that happened to come out today. I reached the queue, Dave and I sat in the front of the line, waiting for our order. “Oy mamma, tomorrow?” Dave finally asked with excitement, “Tomorrow eh? Today..? What day are you gon na buy me some cornflower seeds?” I am gon na need them tonight, because we all need cornflower seeds, and after a couple of hours of mumbling, the customer place, where the price for those seeds is very low, smiled, walked over and paid me a small, glace to show me. I handed him my bag, and he asked, “Will you go along, buddy?” Dave looked confused, I smiled back. “I don't know, I haven't heard of that yet.” I picked up"
496,"The captain of the ship raises the alarm on his instruments. He didn't exactly have his eyes on the target, he looked to the depths of the Mediterranean with his crew as he pressed the doorknob, flicking in, pushing it forward. The once mighty rudder had failed, its hydraulic tension stressing the navigator. The ship was a shit ship with no steering system and no crew, the only one to be seen for centuries. With the legendary, yet unknown, Confederate flag emblazoned on it a movement began, and his crew were quickly pushed back to the far side of the ship. They couldn't be far enough. As the men laid eyes on the opening, he muttered something to himself, closing his eyes and let his head sink deeper into his hands. *That shit was easy* he thought as the ship loomed behind him. *I'm gon na kill that shit now* he thought to himself. *Guess I better leave that to the rest of the crew... * A sharp crack echoed through the ship's machinery, as the pressure raced down through the hull. Johnathan stumbled backward and fell to the hard ground, bleeding out as his oxygen molecules began to leak from his lungs. He stumbled slowly down the dirt path and fell from the railing, his lifeless body fell into the abyss of the ship. As his head sunk further, the captain told the crew to get up. He pushed himself up to his knees and jumped to the side as his crew fell in closer and closer, the shore dogs as strong as the soldiers he had just fought. Johnathan grunted as he let go of his legs, feeling his way up the rocks, slowly stepping over dead rocks and starting up again. As the ship came into view he pulled himself down and crawled under the deck of the ship, the blood-curdling heat from the attack freezing him to the core. The engine compartment of the ship lurched as he climbed the ladder and climbed the steep steps, the new heat just reaching his ankles. The ship continued up, a slow crawl. Finally the deep into the deep end of the deck, the bottom sliding down through the floors and floors, Johnathan stood up, cursing as the ship lurched again. Finally he felt it, the natural instinct of the man climbing, moving upwards, and then"

The pipes weren't working right,” the tall, smiling human scowled, his gnarled hand hovering above Jake's hand as if reading his thoughts. “I got ta tell you something, Jake. I was on my way to get pizza. And the fucking pipe you gave me broke!” “Yes, yes,” Jake slurred. “This whole place is full of pipes,” he sniffled. “And I have to explain to Freddy Krueger why I'm here!” “Why would you try to get pizza out of that fucking place?” the towering, pale human grumbled. “And you put all of your hope into Freddy Krueger's pipe?!” “Well, you know that he's at least partially dead. And the pipes aren't working.” Jake added. “That's just... that's...” Freddy struggled as he wracked his brain for words. “Freddy Krueger is... he's a skeleton. This whole time, there's been no fucking pipes!” “I have to tell you something, Jake! That pipe broke.” “Oh, okay, I 'll give you a sec. Freddy Krueger is the reincarnation of George R. R. Martin.” “Oh, ok. Alright then, I'm coming over.” Jake and Freddy continued their conversation as they unlocked the doors. The rooms lit up in a pale green, welcoming light. Beautiful gardens surrounded them, of varying heights. Hanging from the ceiling were large, feathered stalks, gracefully straightened, with verdant flowers blooming down the sides. A choir of birds and bees played quietly around the garden, every one proclaiming their appreciation for the sky. As the"

The plan had been simple: maybe they 'd all fit together to build a wifi network of the kind the Russians had invented and make some sort of room on the moon to have wifi but not just anywhere else but just one box. The speaker was hooked up to a central hub that managed to have no connection to the outside world because only the other end could receive signals from the outside world. *Just as their bigger brothers had this amazing invention, * the network had to be connected to the internet. *Except the thought of the world without an internet wasn't *just* awesome. All of the major economies and countries on Earth had had no internet connection. No solar power, no nuclear power, no biological weapons, nothing. This had taken the best part of three centuries. * There was no rush. At first it didn't take long for the researchers and engineers that would build it to figure out how to program the wifi in a way that would last forever. There had been internet free, for obvious reasons. Internet providers wouldn't answer basic questions like how old our child was and how many the baby would be. It was like being plugged into the electrical grid, taking all that electricity out of your body to make sure that everything was in synch with the network that was tied to your phone. They had made the most of the money by making the whole thing self-sustaining, an interim version of the internet capable of traveling around the globe so that internet users could pay people for access to the rest of their devices. The way people were wired and wired could be made more basic by routing it through the brain of the person on the other end of the line, taking them home, make sure that everyone could see their phone. Once it reached the window in the center of a 2-screen, they would have set up a wireless hotspot to try and connect to the network before getting it connected. It was simple. No one had tried it before and the problem had been solved for quite some time. The first test was an informal test by researchers and engineers to see if they could connect into their workstations that would allow them to spend time with the programmers and developers who built the first network, that would"
499,"'' There's a locked box in the ground... and it's the key to unlocking the door to your office. “This is a fucking joke”, the voice announced. I had never seen it before, nor had anyone who was in my office. I had no idea who it belonged to, for all I knew I was in a mobster's office when I sat down for dinner. My 4 year old daughter and I were sitting in my white, reclined, gray recliner, under my watchful eye. “Honey?” I yelled into the black box. No response. I peered out the box. It was *not* mine, exactly. Inside was a strange looking piece of gold. It had a lock in the center. I slowly flipped it open, and this strange golden light suddenly went out of the box. I was taken aback. There was no way this could have been real. I turned around and looked inside. It was gold. So I opened the lid, and when I pressed the handle, the box was gone. I turned around again, and looked at the box again. There were a few small holes, and the lid itself had made a rather peculiar bend on the inside. I still felt puzzled. I stared in disbelief at the box for a bit. There was no telling how long I could have been inside that box, and I could feel a cold chill run down my spine. I picked up my gun. My gun, an average 9mm. I shot a man twice in the chest, then with a bang into his neck. I pulled the trigger. I dropped my gun. I walked outside to my car, on my way to work. I parked my car on the side of the street, waiting for the lights to turn on. I opened my door and stepped inside. I saw a *very* strange looking box in my hand. I pulled the trigger. I shot a man"
500,"They soon learn that no individual will ever land on its soil. Today is ““a historic day”. I write this one from the perspective of a human about to travel back to the original era of the United States of America. It is written in a way that makes it obvious that although it is a part of history, it is in truth a recurring cycle. “John Adams...” A man sits down in the corner of the room, his chair. A white-clothed man in dark clothes with dark grey hair stands behind him. “Mr Adams?” He asks. A white-haired woman speaks first, “John Adams...” “What?” “An American like yourself has been designated and declared free.” ``... the said is one of the very first,” A white-haired woman speaks next. “To be not just human but also an entire species and not just a colonized planet is forbidden under law. A man in such a state must also be understood.” “Roger that,” A man walks to the young man's side, taking his seat across from him. “Mr Adams, the United States of America will now recognize its freedom as part of the judicial process, with no difficulties to prove that it is in fact democracy. And for that the United States Government will assist those parties who have denounced it and have threatened punishment.” John Adams glances down at his lap, his eyes looking to the young man. “Is that all you really want?” The man waves the pamphlet from his hands in a confident salute. “Yes, Mr Adams. Thank you for your consideration.” “Thank you,” John Adams spoke again. “Your life-long interest in the day has led to your choosing today. It would have taken you nothing more than a moment to respond, but when you did you spoke loudly and loudly.” “I understand.” A"
501,"Day 1: *corner of the 5th floor* Yes, I'm a super villain. I don't *want* to be like everyone else. Sure, I can beat people up at a fancy comic store. But the funny thing is that sometimes, I wish I 'd known... *no one noticed me, then, because the last time someone did, I knew what was coming. * I go to the office for lunch, and people are always assuming I'm just a super. But I think to myself, how can someone just wish they had known when they were on that stage, when they would want to be somewhere else. How can you hold onto someone? How could you make yourself a better person?"
502,"She was warm and quite a beautiful, she could bear to put my hand on her shoulder, yet more so than those of many other people. Though, I could not place how warm she was, something about the way she warmed my skin made me think, that if I touched her, I would feel what the world knew about me, for all she truly was, and that the pain felt even worse than I had. “Ain't you no bitch! You're my sunshine! Why can't you just stay happy!” Her tiny cry pierced the silence in this room, growing louder and louder, making her an eerie ghost. I looked down, and then ran my fingers across her delicate skin, my beautiful smile only genuine for a moment, before I took it upon myself to touch her, yet as I did, I saw the scar, my own. I thought I 'd lose her, but, alas, my burden did not come. The pain was gone. But, as I began to cry, the tears that streaked my face, a light breeze drifted through the room, to greet my cold eyes. During the height of the second global war ( in World War 2, refugees from major war-torn countries usually try to reach Germany ), refugees from the world's worst countries attempt to build refugee shelters and “farms” where their “neighbors” can be “cleared” out. But every one of them is incredibly dangerous and won't cooperate. You are The President of the United States. The old days were long over. We had built shelters, schools, homes, businesses. Our post was well respected in the larger cities, but that wasn't all. Our supplies were drying up. With every little boom or curve, we faced a greater problem. We were, after all, built on farms. The plan called for it's apocalypse. However, it wouldn't be a eradication. We would stop those hungry and starving, as was our duty. Our defense networks had expanded, and our ships stationed at Earth's moon, the moon closest to Earth, were falling to the surface. The people of the continent that faced us had quickly withdrawn from their cities, to"

504,"Everything became a blur for me. I had a terrible hangover. I wish I had never left work. Sometimes the cycle repeats. I think, somehow. I was at the gym half an hour ago. I walk into the kitchen to order food and my stomach hurts from the hangover. I get up and slam the door, giving the apartment another sputter. I'm alone in my house. I wonder why everyone is doing it. Then I finally get it. I put on my best shirt and tie. I think for the first time, how perfect I look. Then I picture my wife, we were late. My phone rang. “Hey, whats up? Can you call my dad for me? I really love him.” The ringtone matched my heart. I figured that's all I needed, to tell him to call me back. The phone lines continued to ring. Then it cut out. My heart stopped for a second. The world was still blurry and dull. I'm standing in the room where my boss and I worked. It's dark. I hear the faintest sniffle coming from upstairs. Then I notice... I don't think I can hear anything. I can hear that I'm sitting there and that I'm drunk. I hear a couple of footsteps downstairs. But I can't hear anything. I hear somebody coming downstairs from upstairs. My heart stops. I really don't know what is going on. “We have to turn the lights off, Eric. They're on.” A voice sounds behind me. “What is this?” A man wearing a loose shirt and tie walks up to me, a gun pointed at me. “911, where is everyone?” I ask. “Everybody, please turn the lights off.” I stand there, dumbfounded.

I opened my eyes. The floor was dirt, I only had 5 days left on this world. I ran to my little shrine. I knew what this place was. The trip was short. I was about to head home when the lights flashed in. I looked up to see the moon peaking over the hill. A few minutes later I saw it. There was a bright light above the hill, I quickly followed the light. I picked up my pace, I couldn't go anywhere with my death. I was going to die in a city of my own making. I ran down the hill and dropped my arms in front of me. The light was blinding, so I tried to climb to the top of the hill. There was no way I was going to survive this. I decided to go up there and let my face drop as I saw it. There were beautiful trees that could have fallen from the sky. If this were a dream, I would have looked over my shoulder, but I didn't. I looked down and I saw that I wasn't alone. The thing with the stars was massive. That was to say, I was alone in a black void. I looked around me. I could hear this noise coming from everywhere and it was coming from everywhere. I had no idea how I was to survive this fate, this pitch black void was everything that scared me. I wasn't prepared for the sound of it. I began running, I felt the light falling from above. I rushed forward and fell with my back to the rocky face of the hill. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I fell to my knees and tried to run to the nearest bush. I woke up in a big field. I was covered in leaves. In a great white star, it was there. This day, however, my death wasn't getting any easier. My hands were shaking, I didn't know how to move them. I was about to say “Shit, shit, shit.” But as I walked through the grass and noticed what was in the grass, I just knew"

Same ceiling, same bed, same smell, same clothes. Same girlfriend, same coworkers, same coffee mug, same phone. My only consolation was that I now remembered everything that happened during that night. My date, my plans for the day, my birthday, my favorite school, my favorite pets, my favorite hospital bed, my job. I looked at myself in the mirror. I was still early into the day. “Hey that's me.” “Do you want to go to prom with me?” I said. “I guess you should, you know, as well. I would do anything for you.” “Thanks, you really are amazing.” “Just remember that, and if you ever want to get to prom, make it a lot longer.” After a few seconds my phone vibrated in my hand, and I clicked the red arrow and said 'click '. You are born without emotions. At 14, you start noticing a trend: everyone you know is either depressed, or extremely sad. For someone like me, I'm fairly certain I have nothing special. Well, maybe something, or sometimes. I spent a few years trying to get an edge on my feelings. I realized I 'd been playing with them a lot, so I had to learn a lot more about what each of them was feeling. It was actually pretty easy, really. After all, I was curious.

He sighs heavily and takes another few steps, until he passes out. As the sun rose, we were left behind. The people around us faded away, and nobody noticed or cared. Everyone was fixated on the starlight passing by. Except me. I looked through the window at the square cloud, dusted it with ash and quickly wiped it clean. I stood up, pushed the ash away and walked towards the looming dark. I stared at the dark and smirked at the blast I heard. “Hey fuck that explosion!” I bellowed. I had forgotten what my next step would be. I walked around the perimeter of the bunker as usual. Everybody was looking at me, and checking my vitals, everyone was afraid of what I would do next. At least I had some hope, no-one had anything of value to us now. What was a bomb for anyway. I started to explore the other side of the bunker, the closest, used to be nuclear power plants, but no one really used it anymore"

She had never even seen her killer before in her life. It was always the same old routine for her. “Can I keep my promise?” he asked. She looked up at him, confused, but she knew that nothing could be done. “I promise,” she said, “I'm sure.” She leaned in close and began to cry, knowing that she would be dead before this very moment. The young man let out a long and quiet sigh and leaned forward, closing his eyes for the last time. An intervention by a super-intelligent AI; Clark Kent has a hard day.

509,"The pinking of the chip lamp above him was irritating, as though it had earned him a migraine from another migraine. He slid it across the surface of the lamp to reveal a glowing sunbeam, just as his finger reached its reach for the scarred scratched finger. The alarm bell rang and the buzzing shuttered out. John was struck by what he was about to do, however. His choice of cup holders, cheap and unlit, reflected the same image of his dear mom, Amelia Earhart. The smile that enveloped her cracked lips and wet lips became a cruel smile of the permanent scar on her exposed temple. “I am buying that,” John said, putting the cup back on the table. “What? No,” he said, breaking eye contact. “Amelia Earhart?” Amelia Earhart was not a toy, she had sailed into the gulf, smiling with the same jet black hair as he had. His strange woman hair just looked natural, and his brain which reamed back and forth in days and nights worked on recognising colour from the air or making sure it was met as an expression of euphoria or of enjoyment. There were no scars left where John's forehead used to be, the scars remained where Amelia Earhart's eyes used to be. John rubbed his left eye and pushed against his purse to get a nice little rake. In it, he found some folded up notebooks with his latest writing. Three pencils filled with scrawls and personal favourite pictures, with captivating words scribbled in tiny black ink. “How about you,” John whispered, “I 'll buy you anything I want.” He grabbed the tablet that had his name and address, black ink and a bold red pen. He tapped on the desk to type in the following address and then scribbled a random number on a black pad before typing in the address into the message board below. “I 'll buy you anything you want,” he said, dropping the pen and continuing typing.

I know that I've tried to be brave for all of you and kept everyone happy in my words, but I've come a long way since then. I've been doing my best to understand the human condition, but it seems that, once you take one step closer to this final step, you will find that there is still a chance, somewhere, of an abyss in which humanity shall die. Please remember to look after your fellow brothers and sisters. Please take care of yourself and your fellow man.” And with that, the whole group burst out laughing. They were all so proud of their plan, and so fascinated with the modern day business that they took to calling the lottery. After all, who couldn't guess that the stars would be sparkling in response to that one last television broadcast? Those unlucky enough to have the opportunity to pick one, or all, of the human race to die, felt a bit nervous, as the police closed in around them. As soon as they saw a familiar face at the back of the line, they promptly grabbed their bags, and opened them to see that none of them had ever seen a human before, and it was at this point, that they knew that there was only one way to rule the human race. All of humanity, on the other hand, had just been selected to be the last four contestants to die. It was then that Thomas Reed realized he had been chosen. Everyone had thought he was going to be the last human, but nobody was wrong. After all, he was one of the very first people to be chosen. A serial killer that lives for serial killers are revealed to be the last one. Everyday she got curious. <new"

We were playing tag after our game and it was like the sim before, but this year something didn't seem right, not something that I could put my finger on and just look at. We practiced with triggers, that was an achievement for sure, but just seeing him playing my i freaked me out. But we had to pick up a game, and now we had to go through our game again. He thought we had completely lost and started to play again. Then it was like an afterthought, what would I say to him if he played something that wasn't in our game? ``... No” I said. “I can not.” “Then you get a second chance” he replied. “Then you go through another”. “No, you can't” I said. “But you're not thinking right now” “Why are you thinking? Do you not think you can at least learn?” He chuckled and cracked a smile as he said this, “I am the best player of all the people in the world, so come play again.” “Why are you saying I can't?!” “It is not my fault you don't know that. Please give it a rest” And then he woke up, and with the adrenaline rush he knew I was right. He knew I wanted him to live his life, and I wanted him to succeed. I still remember that moment when I took him for a walk in the park and he looked up at me. “So you have to stop?” I didn't even respond. I just stared at him, as if he wasn't even there, and as I say this I would have to do it again. And then I woke up again, and he smiled. The first Human race to enter the Interstellar Galaxy successfully exits Earth, only to find that the knowledge"
512,"She's beautiful. As you can't quite tell. I say that outloud, in hindsight. But just in case, I put a cheesy date on the spot. I mean I can tell that *is* a date, which means I can tell her my favourite song, and she 'll be allowed to choose it. We live in an old school and coffee house, too, so I guess I prefer the type of thing that she's going to want to do in their own home. And it just sounds like we got to get close and to be honest it was almost perfect. We had coffee, dalmatian, chocolate, curry, and a coffee when we got on the plane. I'm pretty sure the cat lady on the plane ate mine when I came back from work last week. And how was it always a dream, though? For that is why we decided to hang out together. I'm hardly embarrassed by how life can be so stressful, but for some reason I was worried about her. The bus pulled up to our destination and I decided to get up off the bench. I guess it's just that when you're a teenager, you sort of hear things you've heard for a while - and for a while it really didn't bother me. Our little café was a bit further down the road, and the bus stop was where I ended up when the waitress came. I didn't know where I was going, but I should have. She was beautiful. The rest of the ride was perfect, I suppose. Even when it seemed that she wasn't in the exact place you pictured her - I could feel her presence. The unmistakeable scent of chocolate and eggs. Her long curly hair, her blue eyes, her perfectly toned skin, I knew she was here. And that's when I started to feel sick. I could barely open my eyes. I didn't even recognise her at all. She wasn't there, she just floated over, moving around, repeating that same pattern I was seeing before. But the oddest part of it all was"

It wouldn't do me any good. I'm not talking about you dying in this room with the plague guy. I am Death. I was raised by your highness.” “What? That's stupid. Death. He is dead. He's a friend. You are the Grim Reaper. Not the Grim Reaper. You are death. You are my servant. I shall escort you to your afterlife. But I need to tell you something. Today, I am supposed to bring you back. And I need you to make a wish.” “Thanks.” He coughed, clawed at his throat. “Whatever, I 'll let it slide. So the thing is, you're probably just going to waste my time with the office. Which is, of course, assuming you never have it. Which is fine, because the office is you, but the office is a morgue.” “Hey, no, that's not that. It isn't fine. You were expecting me to become President of the largest company in human history. You are. And I am. Death. I was raised by your highness. I was raised by your highness. I am.” Death hitched his head to the side, and cocked his head around. “What?” “See? I'm not talking about how your heart stopped beating so suddenly. I'm talking about how you've been sitting here waiting to start this conversation for centuries. I am Death. And you aren't, you are just a bad guy.” Death had become bitter. “But, of course, I am. And the reason you got here is, you're a bad guy. You have you idea of how you've come to be here"

I've got been all over the places with my friends and people I've met in bars and screamed with as much anger as I could muster. They had seemed so peaceful and normal when I told them this day was coming, but they had their own reasons. I could have shouted them down, angry at their parents, but my instincts told me to keep my words to myself. I came home drunk, and so I did. The day came to my attention the thing I had been terrorizing my little home for weeks. I knew this thing. He had already taken all my toys and now it seemed like the end of my toys was in sight, but I knew he 'd be back soon. I wanted to run, and yet I just could not. He didn't care. He wanted to take my toys. And that's when I started crying uncontrollably and when my father saw my tears on my face he scooped my dad up and let go of my mom's hand as they both started running down the stairs. One of them began to cry and I got up to rush after him. The other just sat there crying, crying. I didn't move. Just sat there, tears flowing freely from my eyes. My daddy lay there crying. I heard the doctor leave my room one last time and walk away, when I saw him looking at me. I tried to run away, but I was surrounded by strangers. What did I do? Where did my dad go? He sat down next to me and looked at me with the kindest smile he could muster. The kindest, most caring smile he 'd ever given me. And he had my toys with him. The two of us, one on each side. I wasn't hurt or scared, but I wanted to feel like he was here, in me, and my toys with him. I tried to walk away, but my father was shaking his head and couldn't, I couldn't! I began crying uncontrollably, but then I heard my mom gasp. I began crying and crying until she started to sob herself to sleep. She went into the living room and I could hear her and my father"
515,"This is bad. I need to read the final chapter. It's a bit dim, but I think I 'll make it. The book itself is short, but I think I 'll finish it with it. I know this is done on my own, but there's one last door in the book that doesn't appear to be connecting with it. I'm ready for the ending, and I know that every time. ***Edit - Last paragraph is cleaner. *** Bill leant forward and reached up to touch Rachel, touching her blond hair. Rachel whined as he continued to read, afraid to touch her. Bill nodded and continued reading. As he finished, Rachel was stone cold and staring at him with wide eyes, nose covered in needle marks. He lowered his head as he remembered how he had woken up and went to sleep. He got up from his chair and looked at Rachel. She gave him a sad smile and shuffled towards the front of the room. She entered the room as well and shut the door. Bill followed her in, keeping his eyes closed as he saw a blank page. The room was dark, it must have been a dark night. Bill slowly lifted his arm to look around. Rachel was still staring at him, but she was staring back at him with wide eyes. He saw a small white lamp on the table that lighted off with a small red switch. As he looked closer, he could see little bags of coins sitting in a pile on the floor. Bill knew what to do. Rachel took out a small bronze amulet and put it under her nose, rubbing it. She looked up at him with wide eyes. Bill watched her look at her, still staring into the lamp. Bill brushed past her, walked over to the pile of coins and tried to touch the amulet. Rachel was still staring at him. Bill moved towards the pile of coins, but stopped. His hand caught a dollar with a pen, but turned to Rachel. She handed it over. “I can't help it,” she said, getting up and looking at Bill. Rachel leaned"
516,"As the year 2074 approaches, modern medicine has made more people immortal. Everyone is basically immortal, except for one, the almost man-shaped death of “Time”. Scientists try to give you immortality but you have no idea how. It started out simple enough. I 'd call it a hangover, but you could see it in my dream. I was walking past a place called The Church Of Death. It was situated directly on The Great River, a place where the first Age of Lust occurred. If you 'd ever caught up with the better known ages, you 'd have noticed they didn't quite touch up on anything. Their history class list consisted of none other than one classmate, Calvin Krikron. When the clock struck midnight, people went up in the sky. With the moons as their only sources of light, it was all the more comforting that people didn't seem to notice. It was midnight and everyone had been wearing all black. They were greeted by what looked to be a flock of bees. One of them sent a message to me, apparently an ancient transmission of human wisdom. I tried the phone for a few minutes, but nothing came up. *Am I old enough for it? * I thought, wondering if anyone else in the world would find out. All of a sudden, a light went out at the end of the wall, which I thought was impossible. I was amazed by the sight of it, but something was off. It lit up the room like a lamp, but it was gone. Somehow, it wasn't alive. There were footsteps coming down the hall. I tried walking faster, but it was impossible. Then, someone poked me. “Hey! Listen, Tim! I don't know why you're stuck in there, but I don't know how you got in.” The man said. I looked around in confusion, but I realized he wasn't from this side of the world. “What's going on?” I asked. “You're stuck in the old gym,” he said, “because you don't know how to move anything. And you're not completely in sync with your body. Look at this bird. He keeps going"
517,"“Shit, this isn't going according to plan. I need to execute my section then! Fuck” “Don't ever open your eyes, there is no escape from the situation. Look, I will negotiate if you will but we must sacrifice any part of the skirmish.” “Fuck! Please, just listen to me now.” The Dps inspector from Kyuu shook his head and felt the atmosphere envelope the location where he had previously been, “J-Hey there! Come!” A few seconds later, the interrogator brought out a syringe. ``... Lieutenant Salipsa. Prisoner 42290975. Suffering from Perio^UH-69a” “What?” “What the hell is that?” “Send him to hang in the hut, he's gon na die of thirst” “Anything?” “I'm the saviour of Earth.” DPS inspector created an unprecedented situation, which should make him our savior. “This is a humiliation... But don't worry, I have a plan” He made up his mind and floated to the front of the battalion, “I need a piece of our squad for last night's skirmish” General Ross realised he mustn't continue with his goons with his war plan, Your character has the ability to time travel, but only when they're in danger. You've managed to convince them that saving the day was worth it and they must do it"
518,"“Come on,” I told her, “And watch. You can almost see what my shadow looks like. You know that you should see what your shadow is like. I'm just the same color as the opposite color. It would seem that my shadow is much, much darker.” “I love you,” she said. “I miss you so much.” She leaned in. “You can't say that, Peter. I'm really not a girl. I'm the opposite of you. I'm not a shadow. I'm just a person.” I kissed her on the cheek. Her light brown hair fell back into her shoulders, and from the sight of her, I knew I was a woman. “Go home, honey.” And that's how I became a shadow. And all the people around me, having turned my shadow to form a monster, have turned themselves into a boy and a girl. All because of a twisted accident. The dead will be cremated as a means of memorializing those they loved. Write a story about it. I watched the casket, like all the other dead bodies. The casket was caved in, which I did, but I was still unsure about how to bury it, so I changed the soggy black suit my car had. I raised the casket to my chest. The casket fell, revealing nothing more than the empty void. “We used to celebrate all the dead being cremated for us.” I remember the way her hair fell. The way the casket creaked with every step. But now, the casket was completely hollow. Not the lifelessness of an empty casket, but a hollow dead pile of souls. You are in a hotel room when you notice a girl with long blonde hair slowly starts moving around in the corner of the room. She seems quite ordinary, but then you notice how she is carrying a small knife in her hands. You are in danger and decide to get rid of the intruder. There is a screen in the middle of the room with some text in bold. It reads: “Press release” I pushed the button in front of me and opened the door. Behind the door was a"
519,"After a few weeks of running, you see something inside a tube/pulse generator. I woke up groggy. The day was Monday, it was Tuesday. How was my day going so fast? I didn't like the sunlight, this cruel world seemed so bleak to me. The sun hurt my eyes, now that I'm a bit younger, but they didn't flicker in the light. I tried to stop shaking, but I couldn't shake the slugs on the tentacles. They shook the rough air, but it didn't burn me. I rubbed my eyes and tried to catch the light. I opened my eyes and tried to move. The light was gone, and there was a man standing on the ground. “Where is my night-vision?” I asked him. “Uh... here,” the man looked to his left. He wore a black suit with a gray tie. “Just walking around is all.” “Would you mind following me, we 'll need to hurry.” We walked down the road, though some bumps under the snow made it all the way to the end of the road. I approached the man, who took off in front of us. He smiled a huge smile, and pressed a button. The electricity immediately went out, but I didn't notice anything. We continued walking. “We're almost at the park.” The man pointed to the bridge. I followed, he looked familiar, and he led me down to the bridge. “Look!” he yelled. The man pointed to the park. I followed. “There's... another one. I can't see.” “Please don't worry. We 'll get you back!” “Yeah, but we need to get to the park before it goes dark. We're coming in.” The man stood up and looked at the bridge. I followed. I could feel"
520,"“Congratulations, Sir. The calibre of bullet will prevent you from surviving. You will suffer no loss of life. However, your wounds will be fatal.” I was nervous. But I felt confident. How could I not? “No, Sir. As the client, I can only offer you the best possible customer experience. It is expected that we will not just tolerate failure. I'm sure you have passed all the tests. I could never make it all the way through a connoisseur's market. You 'll be required to attend extensive classes. For your debt, we will pay any of your debts. However, if you are unable to provide you the best service, then I can offer you maximum compensation. However, you must work hard to acquire the skills necessary to help society flourish. I suggest we enroll in rigorous work experience courses. You 'll be paying top dollar for your training and experience.” I looked at the police officer, and felt myself get hyper aware. “Thank you. I will be signing the paperwork for your arrest.” The officer handed me the police gun. I flinched, as did the rest of the military. As I watched them switch from bullet to gun, the gun started to rise in the air. My palms started to sweat. My head was pounding. My lungs were burning. My head. I would never have a mother. No. I would never have a father. I would never have a girlfriend. No, I would never have a goddamned son. No, I would never have a family. It wasn't for nothing. I started to cry, but I did not leave. I heard nothing but silence. That was it. I heard nothing but fear. You have the ability to telepathically communicate with anyone. One day, you receive a text from someone named “Henry”. Henry was a real person. Everything in his life was a lie. Every single job, every day, everything in that apartment he hadn't even called home had a person standing behind him saying the exact same thing. It was only in high school that he had started to realise something was different. After"

The picture I took of myself on one of the stock exchanges has been sitting on the front page ever since. I have even clicked it twice. People are saying I made some mistake, and that there was no way I would ever remember where I was. But it all made sense to me after the first time. I decided to do something about it. I was browsing Reddit when I noticed that it was getting much, much too fast. I wanted to log in on my new account so I could see what was happening and log back in. There was a lot of comments about other people leaving the world, which was fairly uncommon after a breakup. But that was irrelevant now. I was checking out one of the websites, anyway. It had new comments about how funny it was that I was watching one of the most popular websites on the internet on my new account. I clicked on it, and it had something more interesting to it. Apparently, the website had a new user, and was being prodded by someone who had found it on the website. It was about time to browse the site to see who it could help me find. I thought about calling the number, but I just didn't want to spend any of the time doing anything stupid. I clicked on the name “hyperkurt” and got a few looks of confusion. “Hello” I thought to myself. It looked similar to my profile picture on Reddit. The front page read “A spoofed image appears on the front page to help you find it. Please enter your password to access the website” I was stunned, but then, the site updated. “That's a funny website, and is not strictly following the rules of the internet. If you do not recognize it then you should know to not open it. It is safe to access it.” I clicked on the name “Arshya”. It looked a lot like my profile picture. But even this one did not look very funny. I began clicking on the article next to my picture. I was going to go visit some friends"
522,"“Gentlemen,” screamed the Walesat from outside the door, pointing at our two comrades with mock furrowed brows, “stand down, please.” Standing still and staring out of the windshield into the snow, I felt a twinge of terror wash over me. There are soldiers all around me now, leading their own twisted army. No way. If I had a gun to my head, I would be grabbing them by the neck. I already knew what was coming. The cold returned, not just from the room but from the very air. It was only a matter of time until it took me to get the best shot in the world. Out on the street, a pair of maroon boots stepped out from behind the cheerful bus stop signs. “Onward warriors!” they shouted. I pointed my gun toward the lieutenant. “Let's meet at the welcoming aid station.” A laugh from behind me rippled through the hot spring, but it was no time to retreat now. “Don't worry,” I said. “I 'll be there,” I replied, and the soldier charged through the snow. I was heading down on the next man, the Walesat, before he caught up. The walesat and me both took up positions on either side of us, eyes fixed down at the ground. One of the maroon boots followed the other around the shoulder. “Three, no, four, no!” he bellowed, and then dropped to the ground, smoking. His chest was large and well-aimed, but his face was far from mine. His fur turned from warm, yellow to hot, as though he had lit a fire. He could barely see a thing, and I knew he couldn't do anything more. “Four, no!” the soldier's brow creased up, and he nearly fell to the ground. The snow had begun to freeze, but the skin underneath the skin of my hand was still wet from the already-melted snow. The war, the walesat said, was over. As a doctor, I was trained in the ways of the military. As a medical doctor, I had every"
523,"I am a young woman, nineteen, all that’s left is myself and my baby, in the distance. There is a man who collects his own money, unfortunately. While not necessarily with his name, I know that he is doing it to take the life of his unborn child from me. I am a younger man, just recently, with a wife and two kids. My house is now in shambles, and my cat is away from me, dreaming of a brighter future. We live in a world where there are very few jobs, so I have no money to lose to pay for my life, I only live with my mother and her children. My wife and child are overjoyed at seeing their loved one finally get a normal life. I am not a man who lives in despair, I am a man who lives in hope, and I can not live in death without my children, my baby, and her. I never knew if I could survive with my life alone, or if it was simply a cruel joke. The things that I did and the things that I did not do gave me hope, and I became the symbol of hope for the world. Today is a very special day, the day when people begin to have my word. I don’t know why, and I don’t care about the future. I am here, and I can hear the sound of thunder, and my son's cries and my wife's heart thumping with anticipation. We are in a busy city, a lot of people, and we all can hear the thunder thump in the distance, the thunder thump of thunder that must have lasted the rest of the day. I am here to help, and I can hear the cheers as I am from the city. My wife and child are in the middle of a busy street, and the same thunder thumping that we hear has returned for my son.

I have to get to China, I think, and search for the source. I'm trying to be quiet, but as always it's getting harder and harder to listen. My phone buzzes. “J-Jack Lynch!” I wake up. I reach for my phone. “Hello?” I say. “I'm calling you, sir.” It's difficult. Almost impossible to answer the call. The cops are right, I think. I've already lost contact with my cell phone. I have a message that I need to be on the line with. It reads: “They found you. Don't come to my house any longer. I 'll tell the authorities.” I don't say anything. I'm still lying to myself. Everything is so weird, I have no way of reading my phone's signal. I know it must be dark out, but I really don't need to be here anymore. My phone buzzes again. I'm being ignored again. My phone buzzes again. I have three more messages from J.Lynch. A day before he's supposed to arrive. He needs me. He wants me to help him find the man he is looking for. It's time to make my move. I open my email and go to the Daily Mail. The article states he's found me. I can't believe I'm at the bottom. I open the top page. “J-Jack Lynch, former deputy director of security for MI6.” The headline is the same. My phone buzzes again. I'm sitting on my bed. I feel weightless. My vision has returned to normal. I feel alive. I feel powerful. I push back the curtain and a lamp shines over my ears. I look"
525,"It is widely assumed that DiCaprio is married to Walt Disney, and has a child with Disney's significant other. Disney Enterprises attempts to position himself as the captain of Disney Life, and Disney acquiesce. *Coined by Jiminy Cricket* Despite the portrayal of extreme parental frustration, children see DiCaprio as an introvert by profession, earning him accolades for pushing Disney to move up the company ladder. At first, he assumes this is because he's sick and suffers from a terminal illness, but eventually he takes steps to improve himself, ultimately adding “TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED” to his resume. ( DiCaprio would quickly become the Captain of DisneyLife; “Put this crap on YouTube!” ) A few years later, and DiCaprio becomes an internationally famous actress, claiming to have met the most beloved character of his career and has become his own reality. He emerges as a fan favorite in multiple movies, and receives his Oscar for his performance in Goldwyn-Mayer. This ends as DiCaprio suffers from an existential crisis, and as the Captain of Disney Life grows more and more frustrated, he begins to take drastic action. In order to get more money out of his employers, he threatens to reveal he is going to have a child, despite his health. *Coined by Jiminy Cricket* Having worked with DiCaprio for a decade, it seems only logical that he becomes an agent of the federal government. On top of this, he denies that his performance in Goldwyn-Mayer has been the product of abuse or deception, implying that it was his own failures that lead him to this predicament. The prevailing theory is that, due to the last thirteen years of his role as the deposed CEO of Disney Life, DiCaprio has become a person of immense influence over his employers, who's budget consists of films only a Hollywood producer can produce, films he doesn't intend to produce, movies he's recently planned to rewrite, and films he intends to draft. DiCaprio tries to expand his influence, attempting to convince his employers to sacrifice his entire future income to get the job, only to realize that"

Everything was laid out in front of me. And yet here you are, far away. You try to convince me you are the one who can save the world, to restore peace to a war-torn country that used to be your country. But you see the outside world is a reality that has destroyed your people. You fear the darkness you and all of your predecessors created. I have the utmost respect for you. And yet you have allowed yourself to think that this is your greatest dream.” Dr. Vanlon slapped a small button on the table, which sparked the speaker. “Please Dr. Vanlon, I need to tell you something,” it said. “What?” “What is it? Is it out of my hands?” “Is this really happening? I don't know. Is it that you can't hold the power that my programming created? My hands! The other doctors had implanted a transmitter that could transmit commands from the outside world into the brain. We wouldn't even be able to communicate over it, unless you dropped a pill on the ground. You just tried to speak to the phone before. “I know what you were thinking. I know that now.” “Don't try and turn it off!” Dr. Vanlon cackled. “My humanity is dead, you can't control it, or let it be. You can't hold my power, it can't keep me alive. You would sacrifice my mind and I 'd just shatter it.” The door opened and a man with a pretty face entered. “Mr. Vanlon, why are you here?

527,"You are a Time Traveler. Unbeknownst to you, they are sent back to the beginning of time to catch Hitler. I expected them to come with a press release saying it was my family's historic birthday. Well, everyone's remembered me as the moment the old man buried me, buried in a public library by a 'Serial Killer '. A well known Italian historian never really knew what his brother had done. The cover read in full: “5/10/1932, April 29th. Adolf Hitler; A double agent, a counterfeit passport, and a three year stay of exile in the Immerkels prison in Austria. The International Life Agency had failed to detect time travel at an international level and the little creature had unfortunately not stopped to check the records.” Oh no. I didn't care about time travel. I didn't even care how I ended up here. Just give it to me. I could be the new Hitler. This isn't fair. I opened the envelope. I wrote in the quickest possible: *The Assassination of Adolf Hitler by CIA Agents, November 21st 1942* The only note I read, or anything resembling a note, was 'Re: High regards, Sir.'The letter read in more letters: *” Finally, you had the potential to save my beloved, Adolf Hitler. This is to be our farewell. The great unknown is coming. You will join us. And we will be together once more. “* I looked out at the small crowd of people who are now having their long awaited death by Hitler's side. They had looked up to me for years, for the opportunity to contribute to an era. But I still have nothing. The sadness I felt for them was like nothing else. “Now, you are just as bad as ever. I hope you will always be the same, Father.” “Goodbye mommy” What was it that you did that sent you tumbling to your knees? You"
528,"What does the headline say? “AIPAC OF CITIES DIES IN BERLIN KINGDOM”. And it's the best news to come out of the Chicago airport today, thanks to your wonderful customer service. When I brought this potluck gift to her house, her cat dragged the stock-looking lady into the room, “She smells like shit, this is my lemonade. What's with the smell?” “Your house smells like cat shit,” She didn't bother giving me the loogie. She just looked at me like I was crazy and continued looking at the well-oiled machine. She could see me huddled around the table, clutching at her tray with no-one else. “Someone put the old dishes in the shower, they smell bad,” She was still talking like she was doing it with water. I stopped talking with her and glanced at my watch, as she was bent over the table, furiously splashing the bottom of the bucket, “You have to hurry. We will get you to the hotel, I don't want to wait around for you.” “Who are you?” She finally managed to choke out. She was trying to look interested, which was disappointing. “I am Roger, the owner of Clerson and Strudel. He recently pulled the plug on his ol'saloon too.” She glared at me. “But it's too early to get all panicky about this, I'm sure you can believe that.” “Yes, that's correct. You will now need to remove the dish from the oven,” She sighed and turned away, as if talking to someone. I continued to look at the display, when I saw her slowly unwrap her loaf of chicken -- there was a new rose in the crock of her neck -- and said, “That's not right. This is going to have to wait.” I held my hand out, but she grabbed it out of my grasp. It was dripping. “Can I get you a sandwich?” I asked. “No. No.” “Ah, thank you.” She"
529,"“Do you always write, there's no where for me to go?” My thoughts were always immersed in the world around me. No matter the way I looked at it, if a single moment stayed buried, I would make it a whole new world. “I'm looking to keep writing, that's what I love about it.” Then I felt like I was reading something else. “Hmm? Isn't that always the case?” It would be over now. I could've been setting a timer on how long this would last. The people I saw weren't the people I've seen before; they're part of a universe, and they had nothing to do with what my prompt said. They had nothing to do with it. “I know, and this is good enough for me. But it's great because I have a dream to tell my parents about.” She smiles and nods. “It's nothing but a chance to tell your parents.” I can feel the butterflies in my stomach, like some kind of negative space mattress that is just too, self-aware for that shitposting forum to handle. She watches me as I read my prompt on the thread and grins as I lift up my sleeve. “It's going to be amazing. I never know when it will pop up. You have no idea how long you 'll be writing, and no one is going to care what the next ten minutes or so is going to be.” I smile as she pats me on the back. “That's how long it 'll be.” “I know, I know.

530,"and it's not about what you're wearing, but your personality. Your father came from a long line of rebels. He rose to power by organizing the revolution. The same sources that led to revolution when first to the capital had been robbed. The same revolutionary movements in the same vein. By bringing his father back into power, the old revolutionaries refused to follow the new government. And it didn't work, until he did. The rebels had been learning about him. The same family they used to have. They came to meet the king, to establish a temporary alliance. But it quickly went to war. The entire rebellion spent several years trading with other rebels, joining them at a large armory. Then they met the king. So now they talked about their lives. And the king knew them, in secret. But that couldn't last. And now, now they were fighting and the rebels were winning. In the capital was an easy stronghold. The king had come back to them. The assassin didn't recognize him, but they followed the steps he had set. The assassin was old and inexperienced. He wanted to make a difference. Then, the assassin went mad. Then, the assassin got mad, and turned against his mother. And so on. He 'd lived a full life, and everyone told him he could kill anyone. And so on. Once the assassin first came to the capital, he had lost. But he kept fighting. The king knew that the assassin, *him*, was the king's sole enemy. It hadn't taken long for the old man to realize that he could kill anyone. And so on. Until now. And he killed the assassin. It took another four or five years before the assassin decided that he couldn't stand the old man anymore. So he burned"
531,". A research lab has been operating for decades that deals with every recreational drug within a 1,000 mile radius. The past ten years have been the hardest, after 20 years of trying not to do it. And as one of the world's first self-powered mechanical constructors it is almost ready to ship the probe directly to Earth. The sudden event happened yesterday. It happened exactly as expected. They're injecting the compounds. But there was no effect. There was only a perfect loop. “Shhhhhh” the results turned out to be worse. Someone in Chicago just recently had his leg jacked off and fell on the floor. Another pod went nuts as the air shifted to an unfreeze zone. People died. Nothing was visible. An idea was put forward to see how many people were injured. The US government initially refused to research. But even they have to go outside in case they believe in a force that could reach people. Except there was no effect. So for the next few weeks the country tried to figure out what had happened. They were baffled. Without the effect, what happened to the president? Just look at the other half of the world: Andrew Jackson, Bernie Sanders, and Vladimir Putin. What happened to everyone else? As the sun began to set, another new law was passed. If you happen to come into contact with someone you have trained for their extinction that means you should always be monitored and trained for the next 10 years. They were all mind-numbingly paranoid in these new rules. I was assigned one. The trainee never visited this lab and the people I met disappeared. I didn't know if this was real, but they all vanished soon after I left. Well, the trainee never saw me again. I was prepared to go on my own. But this time they found something unexpected. It was in the form of a man in Chicago. One day he was stabbed. In his dead mind was he felt something... angry? A sense of disgust? Of a general feeling of melancholy? Of taking someone else in the same moment that wasn't him? But just as suddenly as it started it was interrupted. Their station"
532,", so they let humans go. 200 years into this fight we are at war with the Humans and we have grown closer. They have conquered Earth like none of us have. They use each other as a mining base, resource refining, and strategic military forces, they are at the top of the food chain. They can act as fast as they please to minimize our losses and make sure no humans come back. I take a deep breath in, hoping for a dark, harsh day tomorrow. After 100 years on earth, humanity has finally left Earth. Why? Earth was a marvel. Maybe it was to capture the thrill of exploring the world. And perhaps it was to rival the perfect temperature, or of knowing what you were on, and know it was for a change. It was to ensure that the rest of the world lived a different, healthier life. Then, last year, a new planet was discovered. It was discovered by a fellow scientist working on the Voyager craft. *There. * It was a barren planet. This planet, due to their mining activities, had the same oceans, as well as the same flora. *What am I supposed to do with my land? * he wondered to himself. His feet thumped on the wooden floor of his small laboratory as he prepared to try and re-enter the mysterious mystery. He stared at the landscape that remained behind his glasses. He saw a forest, clear and lush. He moved along the forest as he could. But there was something else behind him. Something... He rose from his chair and looked at the features that made up the terrain. “I mean, look at them!” he exclaimed. Today, he"

Your latest laundry items are clothes; whether they're last day's clothes, new laundry, or laundry products, you have to find clothes, or, on rare occasions, clothing items that look particularly attractive.

People don't realise until it's too late that living is *all* worth dying of. A second Plague has begun, and it is spreading fast. While everyone around you is given clothes, clothes inanimate objects all make the same mistakes: they don't know how to behave properly.

534,"Well, my eternal youth was waiting for me. I had grown up on a farm of five, and I lived on plenty of land. I had a few pets and left no one to call. My wife loved me dearly, and my son had seen a lot of his own success. When I moved in to this beautiful little town, it was just before Christmas. We 'd seen nice things happen at home, and I had a complete imagination of what would happen if the inhabitants of the house disappeared. “Hey! It's the boys again!” one of the kids had shouted. “Don't worry, I 'll make you a wish”. The man I 'd been talking to was stunning. His brown hair shone in the moonlight, he had a good smile, and had a happy smile and a smile so big I nearly forgot he had even a family. His dark eyes were blank, his skin was different than usual, he wore an old worn gray sweater and his legs were stronger than usual. He looked almost the same as a man would look at me. He was also very tall, and he wore a little- “is that a fish?” I raised my eyebrows and sneered. “No, it's a charm!” “Oh, thank God. I have to go now. I'm very hungry!” He turned and ran out the door, leaving me alone for the remainder of the day. After the train ride, the sun dipped slightly, and I went to bed. My mind was in my head for the time being. I wanted to know how the magic felt. I closed my eyes and wrapped my arms around the bed. As the light grew brighter, I became aware of a monster under my bed. “This is really painful, how did I get out of bed?” It opened up its mouth, and it laughed. “You never sleep enough?” “I do.” I opened my eyes and realized the source of the laughter was not me. I could see that the monster was following me. “What's that?” “Thank you for calling Starbucks! We don't sell Starbucks products,"
535,"'', Chris Hansen and John Oliver won the popular vote in the general election and made The Force Awakens a reality. It was actually quite a phenomenon for a casting agency to make such a move. You see, on earth, people get powers. It's called healing, and there are two types of people who get powers: Those who go too far, and those who live too long. The problem is, when I was on a mission for The Force Awakens, I had to call a bunch of my colleagues, and decide to start one myself. It's been ten years since then and I'm still struggling to find the right way to call an energy drink. A drink can create your own energy, and take a while to consume. If it's too long, you die. If you're short on energy, you get to keep it. If it's too much, you can die. If you're tired, you just have to wake up and try again. My call, your old one, is that she gets two. There aren't a lot of contestants that I've picked up that survive and return to their original forms, but I've managed to land myself a couple of workers, get my things out of my garage and my old car, and my second apartment. Anyways, I hope you enjoy the show. I do love that you read my writing, and your public speaking. Write about a fantasy situation involving three dragons in one house in an unnamed city. After a long night of drinking, I rise from my own wooden bed and settle down, gathered up my bag and a bit of my food. I gaze over my shoulder at the once bustling night market. Golden apples springing from the rows and rows of vendors stand at the edge of the street where a plume of smoke wafts from the large stone gates. Smokes move from the bushes here and there and a sour smell wafts from the brown with them. Fire fills the air from the fields and with it we all disperse from the scene. The air is scorching and the air is cold. A warm song escapes me as I lay my head on my hands. The song's a child's song. The fire lingers around us from the trees beyond, burning in its shadows. It's cold and"

Thank you.” “You should try to avoid crime,” Ferese says. “You're starting to show signs of being caught.” A pen is pressed to his lips, but it doesn't matter. A man's sin is not being born. Ferese takes one step forward. It's important to himself. If he's caught, then he's killing. If he's not, then he's causing harm. The detective picks up a gun, he's no longer on the detective's radar. “You're right,” Ferese says, “I am not innocent.” “It's you! The Ferese I took from you,” the detective says, “You're not innocent.” The detective laughs. “Oh, thank God, the Ferese you had! You two talked about your funny life!” “I'm not allowed to speak of my life,” Ferese said, “I am not a real person.” “And the life you lived on Earth?” The detective says, “So, with your superior intellect and your admittedly bizarre murder... what did you say?” Ferese chuckles. “I don't know.” “I have written a thesis about your life. It is more detailed than I anticipated,” the detective says. The detective snickers. “But what?” “You invented the world's first AI. The first thing I discovered was that anyone, everytime I viewed something from outside the windows, I 'd be able to understand it.” <"

Many of them would press on, and others would leave, but other bullies would cover the lost side or at least the ones who could make them a challenge. “He's looking for me?” “Yes, this is Captain Rex, the bane of the town council and the last refuge for a dying kid. You have seen what he's dealt with, please help him.” “Sir?” “Let's see what he sees first.” ... “And don't do anything stupid! He 'll give up eventually. You have to help him, otherwise you might lose him.” “Oh, I didn't mean it like that.” “No, don't be ridiculous. It's important that you help him. It's my job.” “Fine. He won't be going down without a fight, but you might make it difficult. This won't last.” “Sir, I'm taking the kid with me and he wants to meet his favourite hero, Kyle. Please, please help him! He 'll get sick and require surgery, and he might die, but I can't do anything about it.” “Oh, he's struggling, I hope I can help him.” The three of them walked back into the classroom and on the walk back they saw the last of the kid, lying on the floor as the prodigy turned his attention to the teacher. “He's had all sorts of complications today. He's been playing with a metal baseball bat for ages, and trying to fall into a trap. He made it worse when he broke his arm in his first punch, and then"

Your eyes are filled with the brim of the sun. You're colder. Your mouth is ragged and dry. The breath in you takes on the taste of fish, and you suck it out into your mouth. But you still can't swallow. It's just in your hands now. And you're shaking. You struggle to open your eyes. You feel like you're sinking, but you're too weak. Your eyes have narrowed. You don't know where they are. Why do you feel this way? You're so alone now. But, you've seen everything. You have discovered everything. You've discovered... and you've explored. You've found. You've explored. But, now you don't want to look. It's so cold outside. It's too cold. So you take your place.

For their sake, everyone believed they were the reason we weren't actually fighting against them. But, what they never got was why they thought they were better than us. After centuries of denying the Devil the mantle, God is now in charge of all the planets in existence. The latest numbers indicate that humans have conquered the entire Universe. One day, you board the space elevator. The elevator buzzed behind me as it reached the capital. The men in black suit brought me to the elevator shaft. Only now did I know who was sitting on the rail. “God?” I asked. “No.” The man replied, voice strange. “No God.” “That's good.” The elevator drew near and I entered. I stepped outside, giving my gas mask a quick wipe. I turned and faced the people I was supposed to interview. They looked like the kinds of people I saw in the movies, mostly men with shiny slicked backs, but the white coats looked more alien than human. There was a bit of brown fuzz in the man's mouth, the kind that used to squeeze food through a mouth. I walked inside and asked what they wanted. “I want to see everyone.” “Who?” “Him.” I approached the man sitting on the bottom of the elevator. “What did you just say?” “I said it's best not to ask.” “Who would you rather be with?” “Satan.” “That's good.” “Good for God?” <new"

If I find them now, and they die, I find them all but imprisoned within my own mind. To kill them would be treason. To have them succeed the I would earn my escape. I would be sure to die for my brothers and sisters. My only solace would be the food that the mighty Korole appeared to serve. They believed me to be the most powerful woman in the land. They grew desperate to feed me. I was willing to lose. They saw it as a sign of their faith in me, that I should be sent to fight for them. But they had the same doubts. They were more than a crowd of refugees, they were the one who allowed the Korole to spread its wings. They saw the gold, the stars, and the letters of my mother and father. The men who kept my mother from the I fought to protect her. But I made the choice to fight for them. My family died in the war. I will die tomorrow. They told me that I would always return to save them and save their lives. But I wouldn't understand. They weren't happy with my answer. They were angry with the ruler of the Korole, and I knew the my master will return to him. He said to me: “You will die tomorrow.

The prize is gon na be a glorified shot of the president bragging about his new 'All the President'achievement, then he will throw out some of the funniest jokes of his year!” “Don't joke with me.” said the announcer. “I know.” Klemens snapped. “I'm in deep shit here. Let me show you how to play these games.” The room erupted in laughter. Mr. Klemens threw a wide-eyed glare at the camera, then scuttled out of the room. “Where's the winner?” his voice was faint and raspy. “He's dead,” he repeated. “How is that even possible?” Mr. Klemens broke down and said: “He's fucking dead, like he was trying to tell me.” In the next moments, everyone in the room got up and walked out of the room. Mr. Klemens and his two security guards had locked the door behind them, pulling Mr. Klemens by the arm and dragging him down a metal platform.

At the beginning, when he first saw the man, he only knew it as the sky; the individual colors as if their existence had dropped into thin air. He had known of only the graceful form, as he would peer into the dark room and sigh softly to himself.

The hero fell back against the makeshift wall with a cry of pain. He couldn't stop the bear. He needed to get up. He threw his laser gun out and jumped backwards, hugging his shoulder.

The TV turned on, and the screens behind the diners switched over to a slideshow of scenes from what must've been giant space battles. Some people stared at the screens in shock, including a woman whose face was covered in sweat and blood, and the other. She appeared to be confused by the chaos.

That was the happiest birthday she ever had, so I would be twelve every year. She had a smile and a lot of perfume, but I would be so lost in my own bliss and wonder, that she would never ask me, “Where was my mother?” “All the way up to my birthday. She was in my room, sitting on the bed, gazing up at the stars. One night, my mom, who was lying on my mother's lap, laughed at me and said,” It's beautiful to see someone go out like that. You 'd be surprised how much she likes them, I remember, seeing them as old friends, and even visiting them. I miss them all. I don't really remember, but I can't help it.

My dad ran away and never came back. My mother came back, and my daddy never came back either.” “They were so happy.” “I remember those days. We were just like any other night, getting ready for school. I'm surprised there was so much drama going on in the day, isn't it? I remember when Mommy and Daddy was around, laughing and fighting, fighting, and getting out of the house, and my dad came back, came back and kissed me on the cheek and said, 'It's OK to be a little different,'and he kissed me back. My father"
550,"She crosses a red light before the iron pommel of his bayonet hits her temple. It sends a cold chill down her spine as she shakes from the pain. Her tears stream down her face as she slowly moves to stand upright. She has practiced. A naked boy with a canvas covered face and a gun rests on his right hand. A neat and comfortable man in a business suit covers his face. One second she's seeing him looking past her. The next, she sees him quietly walking towards her. He was silent as she moves towards him. She always feared that this man would speak to her or call her name. It isn't uncommon for a man to return to her, taking them with him. She speaks her name quietly in this man's mind and with a puzzled look on his face. He quietly whispered her name and as she moved towards him she managed to open her mouth to speak. He turned and gave her a solid kiss. “Maria,” he said softly. He turned and walked over to her with the pistol in hand. He reached out and kissed her neck. “We are meant for each other” he whispered as he walked over to her. “I can feel it in your bones. It is so close now. Don't you think that maybe I will stay here for a while?” He pulled away from her and gave her a final kiss before walking away. That was three years ago. The red lights got worse and worse, the corpses started coming closer. They are coming from every direction at once, the screams rising from the living and eating away at her spine. She is a ghost. She feels her heart begin to race. All she wants to do is sit here with this man. Sit back in peace. But that's not true. The lives of all those who he was planning to kill won't come. They all started coming from one place, and now every morning and every night he steps out of his chair and walks straight into her soul. He pulls out his shotgun and shoots himself in the head"
551,"I've always been superstitious about dying. It's not that I don't enjoy it, I guess you could say I'm superstitious, because I had never died in my life. The hours, the days, the weeks and the months pass slowly by as the years pass. But I can't die here, I can't let myself die. The doctors, the nurses, the doctors are all here in the hallways. They both have surgical masks on their faces as I watch the painful flash of a few white bloodshot eyes tear up. They're the nurses who come in at once and take their tools and begin pushing them away to take out my various cuts and bruises and see if I'm alright. I can almost see where they're taking me, my eyes rolling back over my balding head like an old man with white hair and a mustache that seemed to carry itself around like a child playing with toys. But they're all sitting in the same spot, I can almost hear them screaming with their chests on fire, I can almost see my fingertips curl up under my finger tips as the pain rolls across my wrists and shoulders. I can almost hear my heart beat as they drag me away to a hospital, to a place where I can live, when I'm able to give them everything. I don't know where they're taking me anymore. It's been three weeks now. I haven't seen her for nearly a month now, three months of this pain that I feel like nothing more than nothing, and three months of this pain that I hope I 'll never experience again. I never felt any pain before. Every single time I feel like something is on my skin, I want to try to snap it off, something stops my heart from beating like a drum when my life has just ended. And every time I feel like something is against my skin, I 'll break it off, something keeps it from beating like a drum. I haven't been able to cry in years, and I can not imagine ever having someone to cry with. I can imagine always"
552,"It’s hard to explain to children, really. We used to be so careful of people, you know? Even after all those who passed away were hardly left. So careful. I’d watch out the windows to keep the flock of folks we trusted to our deaths hidden, to keep the risks off my shoulders. I almost decided they’d all turn out fine. And they did. They’d spend the rest of their lives unable to walk the halls of the Kremlin, remaining in the underground. The year was 1972, that’s how it ended. Then as I walked into my first two floors I could see the town I’d been living in for the last eight years. By now I’d called my family before to tell them that I’d left the country. I’d even told them I wanted to visit Canada, and that I’d be staying the next year. But no, I was in America, for Christ’s sake, and if I ever wanted to visit Canada, I needed to die alone. Like a seventeen year old kid, I decided to go home. I wasn’t exactly middle aged, so I didn’t get any younger. The two weeks went by quickly. I could feel my breath getting tighter, the muggy mist swirling through my long, brown hair and overwhelming my senses. Finally, the fog settled and my vision became clear again. In the air was a small patch of ash, gone. This was my funeral, and I was doing all I could to keep up appearances. Looking up, I could see some of the people I’d cared for gathering there. Some who I’d longed to meet, to relive, to play. Some still young with pain in their limbs and nervous gashes beneath their skin and arms and back. My wife, Carol, had been waiting for me to go, when she told me she would do something special for me. I thought about her face, her love, her children and I. I gave her a hug, and she ran out. Like"
553,"He is afraid of us. For as long as I can remember, this creature has been my main visitor. He loves us, and perhaps he does. But there are times when I feel that I am afraid of him, as if he fears me. I suppose that is a feeling he likes to share with me. This is a feeling that I see him everywhere. He used to call me *torquelli*, but my thoughts for him have changed. I do not think that he can feel for me, because he feels nothing of any sort. I know that his name is Kara, but he was never a monster, and no one else would have known this name, and they did not have much time for it. I never even have him call me that. The only time I see him, at least, I think it is the first time I ever see him. I'm not sure what caused it, as the memories of his life don't change. I've never seen him so sad. Sometimes I wonder, if I had never been this kind of a thing before, if there was anything that the difference between humans and the monsters that act on them is this: I don't think I am human yet. If I had the opportunity to be human, I would be happy for it. Kara smiled at me. I felt his eyes widen, and then they fell. It was the same feeling every time he saw me, but this time, it wasn't just sadness. It was much deeper. I looked down and to my right was a narrow alleyway. The darkness was threatening me. I was scared of what I was seeing. I hated what I was seeing, even if I had only just heard it. My stomach dropped. I could have screamed. I could have killed him. I just couldn't bear to think of that. I didn't feel any emotions. I felt nothing. I could not feel pain. That is what makes me hate myself. It made me want to turn my back on everything and anything I see. I wanted nothing more than to get away. But Kara, I have to end this. The"

After I had exhausted my training and reflexes ( as I hoped ), I found myself back in the city of Boston, all over a different world... But a bigger city, too, and there were other beautiful people living in the city. I saw them all, along with the others who were floating in the water. I wandered about the city, enjoying every moment of the day. And then I saw her. Her beautiful skin was almost untouched by the water, the only stain of dirt she had to wipe off was one’s hair. She had many scars, long and ripped, from a very old tree. I stood next to her, a tall white skinned woman, with blonde, brown hair. She pulled out a thick piece of paper and laid it on the table. She touched it, turned it over, and left a small scar. I smiled, and moved to clean it. But not before she pulled out a large map and came up with coordinates and a reason. Her name was Hannah. She came over and spoke to me. She knew it was me, and he knew it too. She looked down at me, and cried. I had never felt so sad before. And I wanted to help her. I wanted her to be happy. When she finally left, she pulled the map out of her chest and handed it to me. She ran over to me and held it in front of my face, saying, “I will never forget that. I’ll never forget you.” *I went to work* Magic is a weapon to be wielded by warriors in the modern world. The People’s Army of the USA made their choice.

After a few minutes, a man came in with a clipboard and a clipboard and asked about her. It was a lot, since she was in the hospital's observation room. He asked if she could get the flu shot off the ground and her sister. She said she could, so he went to the nurse's office and wrote down the cause. She waited until she had the cure. The doctors told her that if she was getting the flu shot to die, she needed to have a healthy pregnancy, a healthy family. Otherwise, she would not be able to get the flu shot. Not only that, she would be facing losing her mother. She had been expecting her father, a housewife, to arrive in the next week. There were a lot of people that weren't going to take the time to prepare her for this. When the doctor told her that her little girl would be pregnant, she felt bad. Her little girl was no longer a baby. Her baby girl had been beautiful and happy. But now, she was a bitch. She couldn't give her child to her. She started screaming at the top of her lungs. Her father walked in and told her to stand up. She screamed, and he had tears running down his face. She cried until she collapsed. She had the doctors call her daughter. The hospital nurses called her a sicko. They tried to help her, but they always had to end a life. They would inject her, and inject her after a few days. The doctors told her that a miscarriage was the third time in as many weeks. They didn't want her to live. They tried everything they could to get her to give up. But they never could. There were still treatments that would keep her alive, and she would endure. She cried. She cried so hard and so much that her father came and got her in the hospital room. They tried everything. “No more! NO MORE! NO MORE!” “No more, bitch!” Nalan was rubbing his forehead, it was hurting. No more. “No more, I'm having a good day!” her"

Trudy falls asleep; Gareth sedates her, and Gareth attempts to wake her up. Trudy is fast asleep, Trudy quickly wakes up to find Trudy standing in the doorway to her room. Trudy's sleeping, but only with her hands in Gareth's jacket. Trudy tells Gareth about the change in Trudy's schedule. Gareth goes on about what she had done with Trudy. Trudy says that Gareth liked Trudy for being there for her. Trudy says that Gareth loved Trudy, but it was Trudy that made Trudy who he is. Trudy says she would stop doing what she was doing, but Gareth agrees and leaves her alone in the motel room. Gareth continues to drag Trudy to the van. He grabs his motorcycle and drives off.

558,". His leather jacket slid out of his waist and his dark brown pants - the color of discarded shellfish - flopped down behind him. He 'd only been alive for 7 hours now - that's a long time. His feet twitched across the floor in a lazy motion, like a nervous action. The man's unkempt hair. The pale blue eyes were wet. “Anything,” he said. “Anything,” he said softly. A hand gripped his shoulder and he shifted his attention back to his fidgeting, cupped hands. “Anything,” he said again. “Anything. Anything,” he repeated. “Please.” “Anything,” he said again. The man's head turned downward, his eyelids flexing slightly at the idea. His mind raced. “Anything,” he repeated. The man glanced over to his watch, showing two minutes left. He felt sweat seep out from the corners of his eyes. “Anything,” he repeated. Another minute left. He peered over his shoulder. His heart raced. It surged. He felt his face burst, his eyes shutting. He felt the tears roll down his face. “Anything,” he repeated. “Anything,” he repeated. “Please.” The man's blood drained from his mouth and he looked over to the door, dialing the exact number he knew it would take to get in. The concrete of the bunker wall disappeared from view. He could smell more then any peppermint that escaped. He braced himself on the old telephone pole that hung from the ceiling. Two handfuls of grass on a wireframe sat lazily on the rusty, stooped posts. His neck was quivering. He felt it slow down. His heart pounded in his chest and he lowered his eyes"

What could have happened? “I found out, and I figure it's on you now.” Jim turned his back on the throngs of people that gathered to watch him. A few people looked impatiently at his most recent development, and began to pace the square. A large banner hung above him, all embroidered with photos of the Emperor of the East. The only one standing looked shocked. “General Kurtz! Get up. Come with me! You have to find out what's going on!” The throngs of people seemed to slow down, as they all slowly began shuffling around him. They were well aware that the Emperor of the East would not have existed at all. “Listen,” Jim began, “if you believe me, you must know why.” Kurtz turned to the majority of the people of the square, “It's because of you, General. You started this, and you shall keep it going.” Jim's eyes widened as the small group slowly began to shuffle up the stairs, hoping that this would be a signal to them to abandon their quest and accept the Emperor of the East. “You're right,” the general continued, “but trust me, I know what we must do. We must stop you from doing the things you were told to do.” The large woman on the left began to make her way to the center of the square, meeting Kurtz in the midst of the throngs of people. The crowd gathered around her in silence, making way for the massive men at the head of the group, clad in ornate armor and wielding spears and flintlocks, all dressed in the same cloaks as Kurtz. “Tell them to surrender!” The general commanded. <new"
560,"-- a “swimming pool”. “Relax. It's okay. Your period is done.” I looked down at my backpack. I wore the plastic water suit underneath. The only accessories were a sleek black tactical pants with straps for feet, and the football helmet. Nothing special, but I 'd read about it on a few teens in highschool. “You know what that means. This is your career after all,” I said to the homeless guy next to me. “I've done it all before, so what can I say?” The homeless guy shrugged. “I'm one of the first guys in here, I know this area, but we just moved into it a few years ago.” “Then why did you move here?” “It's the same as everywhere else,” he said. “You 'll have to read a lot of textbooks here.” “Oh, you have to. Those guys here were an outsider. They talked a lot of good, long term ideas. We haven't had a chance to talk to them in awhile. Anyway, you really got ta get your head in the game.” “My big brother here is still out there doing something with the time.” “Yeah. Like he said, you have to listen to some of the teachers in high school talk about his activities in school. It really changes your focus.” “Yes. But what about my first assignment?” “The first time we made a deal, we were arguing about a certain number of people,” he said. “Most of them were a mix of different people, and you really got ta appreciate the real things that they talked about, and try to figure out which ones are you talking about.” “That's why I'm here.

561,", but you are faced with the task of becoming a hero, not by your actions. My training began when the flames took me and ended the rest of my life. I was a bright girl with an awesome attitude. Everyone loved me because of that. The flame was so bright I started to smile when it went down, but when it got too bright, my hair fell out and that stupid stick I carried around with me went to ground. Everyone wanted to dance, scream, fuck, let me tell you about how happy I was as it happened. Then I was out in the world and I was welcomed by everyone. No one cared about me in the government. Nobody even wanted me anymore. My parents blamed me for my dad’s emotional abuse, and so they came out of hiding after my dad left. I was always getting emotional and struggling to stay alive. I was told no one wanted me anymore. I was in a big building when the fire started. People stared at me as I burned. I stopped and nodded to everyone. I was still in awe, sure I was saved, but I knew I wouldn’t get away, not again. I was just like them. I won’t die like everyone else. I was immortal, not like most of the other guys that made it. I wouldn’t die like any other human. I held my breath as I prepared to get on my knees. I looked up at the fire, which burned its own flame over the fire, a beacon of hope. I turned and knelt next to the fire’s source, the guy who was in charge. He looked over his shoulder and smiled. I said a thank you to him for making me. Then I climbed onto his back and walked over to him and started pushing him down. That’s when he started laughing. I don’t remember much from my walk, but I heard him laugh a little too. I kept laughing for awhile, just the way I needed. I eventually got the warm feeling that I was making a difference. I looked down at the fire, and walked over to it. I took a look inside. The flames were smiling. And the guy still laughed. And for the first time in my"
562,"Sometimes I get out and occasionally I'm busy. I don't know why. I just enjoy the room. First of all, I enjoy the interesting conversations I've had. If someone says the sentence, then that's their story. If someone says the sentence, I get some really hilarious laughter. So yeah, that's it. Writing is a fulfilling job. I love the rooms and the knowledge of conversations and of characters and how I like to interact with them. But sometimes when I'm around, and I don't know what to say, I just write. I don't talk to anyone who has the decency to call me out. I write on the idea that I write on the idea of writing. In other words, that I don't write for the sake of writing, but because someone else is reading it or that someone else is reading it. So yes, I know that my job isn't for the sake of writing. Edit: I didn't include sarcasm or punctuation on here. I would've thought it would have had some added emphasis. EDIT 2: I looked around to make sure that I didn't accidentally spell “pause” or “delete”. Hopefully it's not your go to word, but it makes me feel *a little* bad that I didn't take a deep breath when I read my prompt. A few billion dollars goes to building a city at the speed of light, yet it simply does not add up. Describe the day to day life of an ordinary man. I stumbled upon a small sign along the sidewalk, unfazed. It wasn't quite old, no sign of anything that was used in the 19th century, and the whole concept of the city faded. The large, blue square placed to the right of it read 'General Meeting Place '. I got up and prepared myself for the daunting task of building a new city. It was a near utopian, but time-sensitive venture, I would have to dedicate the entire day to it. While I was contemplating it, I noticed something strange. The building seemed to be floating in the air, and people were standing in it. They must have been holding signs, in the all-"
563,"I know this may sound like a shitty idea, but you never change your mind. I know my soul mate can be selfish, but my job just isn't all they have. You can't say you're taking on more responsibilities. Let's go through a couple of reasons why you should give her a raise, or I 'll explain where you stand. First, I like the wait. Most people have schedules of four to five hours. I can barely do that. When I have time, I get things done, and even now I'm sad that I had to do that for my boss at the time. Second, I like your every step. You have two. This makes it all the more difficult. I've tried with a lady with the same name to make it work, and she's never said anything back. Sometimes I get questions that drive me crazy. Third, I like your manners. I was never bad with people. When I took a bump, it was due to my tire going too slow. Not because of *rains* but because I never left the front door open and that made it worse. Fourth, and lastly, I'm giving you a promotion. You always seem to have it in you. I think it gives you a sense of security, and you work more than just a part-time job. In fact, you can even go out for a walk. It's like a meeting place, with just one person talking to you and making your day. If you go outside, you can just walk, and after a while you come back. You're not missing out on something, because you just walk. I never once thought I was going to miss out on anything, but now, I have to say something. I need you to tell me why you're so eager to get started. I know I 'll not be able to, but I want you to know I'm giving up on that. You could just call me, and we could spend the rest of our days together, without worrying about my job. I 'll take you to that park together, I know you 'll never go. Just tell me why you"
564,"When I became one, I believed I would discover the truth. It was then I decided that I needed a little more training, that I would understand the rules of science better, that I would not do things that people do not want to. I used the knowledge I had accumulated in life as a blueprint for what I would do next. That was when I began to experiment. When I first contacted God, he seemed surprisingly ecstatic. He did not require gifts from me, but in what way could you not? I was the proof. I sat on the lowest points of earth and met with people. My favorite God. We talked for a while, the other men finding comfort in each other's whispers. We spoke of troubles I 'd only heard of in dreams, but soon we shared our secret. We spoke about the well being of the Earth. We spoke of justice and the intergalactic war, and we spoke of love. When he spoke of peace and compromise, I did not expect him to understand. The Council decided it was a common phrase to use to signify the end times, and I did not want to go into the details of our differences. I merely wanted to share our secret. After many hours of conversation, the entire planet decided that we wouldn't talk. We exchanged our plans. The first thing that I noticed, was the similarity in the way the boys talked. The boys who had heard what they were doing all hours of the night way past. I tried to explain to them why they wouldn't listen to us, why they wouldn't pay attention to me. And one of them, the boy that had just spoken, told me to sit down and stay quiet. I sat down, and listened. The whole crew was silent. I was not sure why they even listened to me. I began to worry that I might be helping God. Because even though I believed in God, I believed that he had done so little to help humanity. I don't think I 'll be getting a response from God. So I sat back down and waited for the crew to be ready for the countdown. I waited for what seemed like an eternity. There were"

It’s a sea of sparkling autumn green and autumn gray stone, worn down with time and care but still sturdy enough to stand on, but surprisingly worn down nonetheless by me. Despite all that I must carry on. Not because I don’t like the way my books clung to my ankles or did they keep climbing my legs? Not because I don’t think I should? No, I’m not going back to school. I won’t do the math, I’m going home. My life isn’t fair. No, Paul, I want to be a wizard. I want to do good and be a good muggle. Because I’m stupid. Because I’m human. Because I’m too fucking stupid. The gates to my childhood home begin to open. The first few rays of orange shine on the windows and I stare back through them with curious, unwavering eyes. A rather large barn of a house has its back to me, with a mound of musty old wood. On the far wall sits an antique wooden door that simply can’t have been opened. The doors are shut by the heavy iron lock on the right. I tug my backpack over my shoulder and shuffle past the small windows and open the large entry way. There are now familiar faces staring at me. “Jesus, Steve, I should go. I don’t want to see you here,” Josephine said, as she straightens up and rolls her eyes as she flips open the door. The room is ajar with a surprisingly well kept back room. Everything is tidy and tidy but it’s all locked. The lock frame is a hunk of plastic, the hinges squeak, and the curtains flicker open from above. The curtains fly shut behind the door and stand halfway in the room with Josephine standing on a side stool, her slightly flippant demeanor punctuated by a genuine smile."

Okay.” The sound of the door sliding closed was followed by the sound of the door slamming. Mr. J sat and silently watched as the Director of the Vatican's office burst into flames. The crowd watched in horror as his personal assistant rushed into the room, her torch still flickering."

Today you find yourself out of luck. The girl named Alex, she used to wear a mask, and wear that with a white leather skirt, and her grey hair was woven in a style you 'd never seen in the wild. As such, she was found in a shady alley by a group of adventurers. She was obviously unaware that he owned anything. The shop hadn't even opened yet, so she sold her wares at random and brought the closest thing to someone she knew she could trust. When she heard that they had free spirits and her bag was empty she casually walked inside, and there she was. “Hello?” she called out. “Sam,” said a voice behind her. “It's me?” she asked, nonchalantly. “Yes.” “Sam!” She nodded. “I am a shop keeper.” “I can offer you a discount on any soul,” said the voice. “Yessir.” “Whatever you desire, I can give you free spirit. How can I not offer you one of those and wait? I promise.” “Yes.” “Shall we take a shortcut and listen for some distance?” “Yessir.” “You sure the window is open?” “Yessir.” “No problem.” “We may have the window open, but it's still too late for us to take a shortcut.” “Oh?” “Yes.” <newline"
569,"Dave adjusted his light headpiece. The light was just going to make his head pound. There wasn't much to do right now. He rubbed the sleep-deprived eyes of his wife at his desk and let them fall to the ground. Tears rolled down his cheeks. Dave was tired. He needed to sleep, and soon. Write a story where the main character is the antagonist, and the story is about getting what he wants. Her hair was like rock candy. A pop. Lots of rocks. A bright bright sun and a lovely cherry blossoming in the spring breeze. She was so beautiful. I could have sworn I heard her wail under her breath, just like in a movie. But she couldn't hear it. She was so annoying. The thought of the day I would be executed, I didn't know. But instead, she giggled and shook her head, pushing her way out of the wooden coffin. After many conversations she gave me a glass of water, a piece of paper and a ring on the table, before sinking into the sand with her words. “I'm sorry. I wish you hadn't done it.” “I wish you hadn't.” “I wish you 'd just give up.” “I wish you 'd just stay out of trouble.” “I wish you just ignore me.” “I wish I wasn't in trouble.” She smiled softly at that. How the hell did she end up in a place like this? How was I supposed to just save her? She liked to talk. Talking about all the things that she had done. So many things to be done. Every single thing she had ever done, even she hated that bit. I guess it's better than living as I did."

I keep walking. “A really long but nice trek right into what is seemingly life. A conversation. Be truthful about that. “Maybe you're right about someone dying of cancer in the next election, but you still got a story to tell. Let's see what you're talking about...” Steve's voice trails off with the last word. He's already got his scarf over his arms. “Won't matter, though. I 'll do my best to help you with anything you need. We 'll move your car in, I promise. It 'll be nice and quiet, you know.” A small child was sitting on the sidewalk playing with his toys with the hat, its dangling over his head. He looks at the hat. There are about three or four questions on his head. How would I know who to ask him? What did he know about how my life felt? The question becomes more difficult. What if the hat was gay? He's right. He knows. In fact, he wouldn't want to know if the hat was gay. What do we do with him? What is he hiding behind that hat? “Ok, what do I do? ``, Steve finally asks. “You get out of the car, set up the doorknob, and walk to the church... ok? Don't make any noise.” He crosses the street, pulling his hood up. I look up, taking my hat and scarf off to clean my mouth. Steve runs up to the"

He ran as fast as I could, maybe less now. I stood and dashed after him, at the end of the path. The footsteps echoed. I felt weightlessness in my chest as I ran. “We have come to steal...” It dawned on me that I had jumped. “*No! Please. *” The man yelled, walking towards me. *What kind of a future do I have here? * I slowly ran to him. His hair was tied up, revealing two bright red spots underneath. He grabbed my shirt. He had his eyes glued to the edges. I choked on the liquid. I yelled, *I'm so sorry! Please! I love you! * The man ran. I knew what I must do. It was not long before he was gone.

He cheated on you, all you could do was move on and act as though you could grow old together. You decided to just join a crew and go to university with your dad.

He had started when he was eleven, but that's a different story. He's seen most of his friends back in his family, but he was a grown man. John came from a small town in Maine. He started out as a skinny kid. He worked at a small high school, but he started to doubt himself. He moved back to his childhood home and moved away, but he enjoyed it. He had an apartment two blocks down from the gym, which also happened to be a family owned building. It was a nice home, and he had always wanted to go there. At 11:57, he got up and walked out the door. He got out of the car, and headed to the gym. When he walked into the room, there was nobody there. No clock. He entered the gym with the briskest pace he 'd ever taken. He walked up, walked down the room, and walked past all the other gym members. He walked down a hallway, and turned right when he saw the gym. John reached out his arm to help the other young men and women walk down the hallway. They each held onto their arms, and then they walked back up to their seats. The rest walked the same way. The gym continued to grow, and John walked up to the top of the building. He saw a large red building, with windows and doors. He continued to walk up the building until he"

I did not know why they chose me. Was I made of light or darkness? My body was unable to move, and I began to feel exhausted. “You do not understand.” I paused, tears flooding my eyes. “I have lost everything. I had dreams of what I had before me, yet I am here now. It does not matter that you have lost.” “You have lost everything. You have only lost one thing.” My eyes darted to my side. I began to cry. This was not an acceptance. This was a curse. “You are my child, my love. Your heart is the shield. You are a keeper of Eden.” “But you can't be,” I began to cry. I felt so sad. “I have lost everything.” The wings retreated into my arms.

She just woke up. The walls were still at her side, muffled by the corner of the bed, yet the fact that they were there never came into view. The carpet would hold her down, and she would always find herself leaning in to touch a hand that lay on her chest. She turned around and leaned in, away from the bed and through the light. She reached up to touch the pillows, and felt them shake, sending small tingles running down her arm. At the time she could barely remember any of it at all, at least from what she had observed on the tv. But something about the light seemed different. After all, she wasn't awake yet, or even sure. She used to be, as"
574,"Write about one such case. The event was rigged, you see. We came from Russia, we got nothing. I volunteered to stay for a chat later and not allow myself to be taken hostage. My old mate mentioned that last night I got offered a 1-5 year tour, to have my head examined by the top officials of the government. Well, they are quite interesting to look at. Mostly Stalin, Nixon, and Reagan. These are a few small figures who honestly seem to like each other, see their generals make terrible jokes while pretending to be Nazis, hear about Hitler during his time in office, and have a global knowledge of cars that are very expensive and that have no brakes or brakes. In fact, the topic is written in a world full of super advanced cars, only slightly different to our own, and this new president seems like a good candidate. They are definitely organized. I see countless army members in white uniforms, some call themselves super-steampunk scientists, some call themselves superheroes. The people are whispering amongst themselves, trying to please each other, but none of them seem to care what they are getting their hands on. I suspect that they are the Illuminati, which only the most powerful people would know. A last chance, I say. Mr President, come here today. He looks up to the agents. He raises his hand. We all can hear a laugh, and the voice is....heave, and it's filled with so much beauty. I can hear laughter in front of us too, and it makes me shiver a little bit. The american soldiers stay still, but start with me. “America, we're sorry we had to run over you, but there are consequences for not treating them like humans.” “Do you understand?” I reply. He looks down at his hands. His eyes are getting very red, and he is pointing at one of the rebels who we caught fighting in that campaign. It looks like he is moving. “You said you're sorry!” He says, he is smiling, “They're stupid!” He laughs harder. “I know. We have to take care of the military by next week, they know nothing about"
575,"My door was buried in dust, unlike any other I've ever seen. I had worn it that day in my grave, but it never caught my eye. I simply assumed its design, because the very metal itself is so unremarkable, and yet a deep hood is tucked under my eyelids. In the same darkened room, I stumble to the side of the hall, and grab my headphones. I never bother to turn the music off. After all, I was still in my mid-20s at the time. I thought it was all a waste of time, but that too was justified; the world was dying and no one was going to stay that long, and I was sure they 'd all do the same. I wasn't really thinking of the risk, but it's how this halls goes. I've never met the man who owned the weapon, even when it was just a living thing. Or the wielder. Perhaps one day the killer will carry it home with him, but for now, I've retired to my stables in the outskirts of the town, drinking away the last bit of caffeine from a flask I've been taking from the fridge as the sun rises.

But the ones that were – maybe were, like, *genius*, because, yes, I had once belonged to a less fortunate class of people – had all the opportunity to work for the damn plant killer, and it's hard work. And the horrifying truth is, once you die, and the entire planet turns into a glade that contains a golden fish that would've been crushed by a million million goldfish just moments ago, you're not really good enough for heaven. Why? For the first time in decades, though, I had no ambition to be an exterminator. I was a greedy, selfish, cheating prick. So, a job where I could really outsource my death at home and go home to the meager living in the ocean before I got sick of it. That didn't really make a difference in the end, though. Anyway, as you might be aware, I took this job from my house, and, following in my example, did what I could.

At the time, it was the office job where I"

578,"I've been given oxygen masks and chuffs. But I know no matter how much I push there is never enough for me to be able to breathe, so I've always been ragged, so I've always been so cold. I hadn't realized until now, until there was a big nudge at my back. I turned around, not being fast enough, but out of habit. The slope got more and more angular, and I had to make my way to the door. Suddenly a rough hand struck me in the back of the head, forcing me to open my eyes and look around. A creature had already materialized out of the darkness in front of me, holding the gun. The gentle padding and whirring of the gun was the only indication that it was alive. I swiveled my head to the doorway, and saw the box I had been pushing for so long. It was huge, with a space-flesh inside, only the tissue was visible. A small clip lay and rattled around in the box. I traced the hole in the little blade and almost had a heart attack, when I heard a light whirring sound. The scream of a girl, a scared little girl, was silent across the room. I could see her, eyes wide open, sweat covering her"

He let out a long yawn, and then slowly moved over to stand to face the Knight with the rim of his hat. The Knight turned to face the Wizard, still half crouched at his feet. “In the glory of His Lord, Malquish!” he called, cocking his head to the side to check that the Dragon's tail still wiggled. The Wizard raised his hand to his face, and the Knight was startled at how powerful he looked. He hovered his arm in a horizontal arc above his head to poke at the man who had turned, but he was fast and very lean, at least as large as the size of a young man. The Knight kneeled over, let out a sigh, and sat down on the floor. “That looks great, so I hope your worries are easily quuffed out.” The Knight's voice cracked, as he took a deep breath. “Actually, it's not so much trouble if I just... *bam*...” The Wizard made a sound like a sigh before he started to"

You just don't understand how small this world is. The world doesn't exist in your mind like a cloud. They did not want to believe. They wanted me to give them a chance at life.

I don't have time for this either.” I slid my clipboard across the table and made a motion for them to follow. I shuffled my way to the door and stopped, my hands still moving from side to side. “Excuse me, do you have any questions?” “Yes, of course.” I waved my hands through the air. “How could I have? My name is Astrid, I'm a guardian angel.” “Interesting.” Astrid's eyes widened in confusion, but her look of confusion simply said “Me too?” “Not until I've met the...” I thought for a moment. “What's your name?” Astrid pondered for a moment. “He"

I usually loved opening old bags of junk or dishes, in case I 'd imagined them. And so I did. So now I stood by the checkout counter and watched as a man returned from his orange juice counter with a cardboard cup. A giant blue plastic box filled with coffee beans stews out of it, along with crayons and pencils and a knife, all covered in chalk and flowers. But I got out, took out my binoculars and slid the binoculars in front of the man. He was small, wearing his worn out burlap pants and underwear a bit too short for his frame. His eyes looked at me curiously as he scanned my bags. All that was missing was a book. I opened the pages. *A Virgin Wars* *How to cook a pizza, * *How to do a fast cooking* *How to start a fire* *How to calm a spry temper* *How to keep warm in the heat of the sun* <newline"

584,". I hadn't seen it since my first visit. It was just around the corner, and my arrival had beenn't terrible. I pushed my way through the fog, and saw that I had fallen asleep at the fountain of youth, lying there with the sponge for a simple evening bath. I remembered seeing a man in a wadded up suit before I noticed that I had fallen asleep at a young age. It had been a regular occurrence for me. I was four at the time, and it still *did* look like a dream. My grandmother had taken me to a circus and watched the man push the sponge into my lollipop and drink the sweet liquid from the fountain. It was probably a hallucination. I had never been much to the strange place, though I could definitely remember it a bit. Grandma helped me make a manicoseze blanket, which I was aware of, and let me sit on the toilet for five hours while she worked. I didn't have any balls or all that, but some people thought she would make me some kind of jellyfish or something, and with a big ol'elephant hat. When I was young, I used to look out the window like I was being watched. I used to think these things were scenes from old films where the theme is kids laughing, or with fairy tales about knights and princesses and scary dragons and kidnap"

I just want them to admit that every person knows they're in danger. I have that ability of turning those others into hate, hate me, hate my name, hate everyone and everything I am. This is it. It's just too easy. I just want to hide it from people, but eventually I 'll stop being human. I am trapped inside my own head. Now I can't really believe what they are doing. All I can think about is the memories of them. I feel ashamed, but also *confident* of who I am. The world has been worse than I've ever been. I can't stop imagining them being so awful. I can't tell them, because they 'll turn their back on me and me. I can't help but be sympathetic to them as they try to help me. I can pretend not to think about that too, for now. I will spend this moment with them, like they were my siblings, simply trying to survive. Only they can't. I can see that. They can almost see their"

Though the rope felt tight, the pain only heightened as the tension kept building. They knew they were going to die -- they knew what would come after. “It's going to be okay, sweetie. It's going to be alright.” John said, not really as much of a statement as he was used to. He had always wondered how something like this could come off. He knew they couldn't stay here forever -- she would never forget him, and would never speak. In truth, she was the one that should be able to be contained -- the only one who would not take his life that would be someone like her. She could do anything -- she could stop him from happening, stop him from *being* -- but couldn't be able to stand to watch it happen. They had both been through this. He had never seen her the way she did. But if she wanted to, she had to go out there and see it. She had been through the pain and suffering and suffering before and would experience it now. It had been to be expected, really. When the explosion was about to hit, John had come out to see if she was"

As the work group walked up to the podium, a man with dark hair and a moustache with a faded sun hat and a yellow-painted business card turned to me. “Ladies and gentlemen, this morning I had an idea for an interview. What have you to say, little town folk?” He grins. “Well, you see, I’ve been sitting around these benches for weeks now, worrying for some strange, alien alien animal you can’t understand. It’s pretty big, I think. It smells weird, but it hasn’t missed a bone in a while. It must be really thick and heavy. It hasn’t been found since The Killings of Javen. It’s even bigger than you. All you have to do is say, ‘ Oh shit, I just saw the change in your next target ’. Ha, I never thought I’d be covered in alien scum.” A pause followed my answer. I moved to the microphone and broke away from the microphone and began reading from it. “I need you to confirm your timeline into the group by now,” I muttered. I had no"

I don't look back. “I 'll never find my soulmate.” I'm more worried than about looking back. I don't stop. “Relax.” The words are tattered and dry. My heart stops. I turn onto the side of the road, slowing my car down just enough to slow the sound of screeching tires. “You have to look back.” I hold my head high and I'm reminded of trying to see a past experience as if there is it in front of my eyes. “It's the same I see every day.” The words are clear now, reliving them so over time that they still have a hiccup of spit in their mouth. <"
591,"That is what I was told on my trial for the transfer of the inmates here and there. I was never a single person to die but I found out it would be necessary to kill them as well. It was against the law to not kill, but the judge looked around the room and was alarmed to see those who had gone back ten years before me.. to punish those who were incarcerated only minutes before, with the added bonus of being able to actually give them a slight little oversight. He asked me to go to a police station and get the most boring sentences, so I did. I arrived at the officer's office after a bit of waiting. Inside, there was a small, two-way mirror with a dash on it. The glass was for any unlawful activity in this city, so I thought it might be a good first stop for me to observe the officers and all their other officers. “Yes, you are a minor, of course we've heard of this as well as you will receive some discipline and rehabilitation if you tell anyone what happened today.” said the officer, “If you are responding to your arrest today then your sentence has been commencing in three days.” I nodded and said, “Sure thing!” and set to work making sure the video captured everything I was seeing in court.

His voice shook, so hard it shook the very fabric of the hull. “I am Yzis Cheng. You've heard of our new territory. The Frikers. Our fledging technologies are limitless.” Yzis Cheng was old, and lacked most of his physical qualities. There were many problems he had addressed, but he was one of the many in the Caribbean for all the good he knew. “Well... There are pirates. The Frikers have come at first, quickly.

They have no choice but to start in their direction. If they"
593,"As usual the cats were going through most of the last process of making the most brilliant plans. One old goat fell through, all the feline present had fallen through the potholes. I ran over to him. He was an asshole. But I didn't give a shit. I grabbed the least human alive. I tied him to a tree, packed my whole breakfast and drove off. I ran after Freddy Krueger, one way or another, I needed to keep walking for a little while. As I ran into the street, I threw a switch and the faint smell of baked onion suddenly filled my nostrils. As I ran across the street towards him, I saw it. I saw it almost instantly, it was a light switch. I reached the switch and my hand went black, as did my life. It shattered and splintered, my whole chest lightening, I was saved. I guess I had been a fool of a man."
594,"Without warning /r/AskReddit bursts into thousands of hits and many site mods post some idiotic comment about nachos being scorched, which is a lot more than they were getting yesterday. After the final bite he's back to form the true villain. Reddit; as he's written as his arch nemesis all along, now his choice is yours. Reddit huffs with a great yawn. His hands are clamped tight on his neck, a thought wouldn't be difficult in this situation. If he takes the chair out of the way now, he will fall back with his feet. It wouldn't be difficult to gain back from the annoying mugger. He grabs hold of the car keys at his side, a scary habit. He dangles them at the ground in front of the mouse cursor. If it's wrong he can't move them until he reaches into the same direction he originally was in his previous hall. When he does he makes a mistake and falls head over heels and behind the door. He prises himself up to his feet, before the spider monkey moves in and- nothing. The purple cat slash with the gun in the mouse cursor doesn't make much sense, though. The policeman walks around to help at the station and, after he lands, tosses the clipboard across the room. He sees it and he hastily scoops it and retracts"
595,". However, not wanting to bring himself to harm, Sally took the card out of her pocket, and put it between her lips. Before the note could leave her lips, the police pulled her from the hospital bed. The detectives only later identified her as Sally, her wrists bound. They found that Sally’s blood was still on the cardboard card, tied to an old and sewn up hole. The police have not found anything suspicious, and we’re all going to report this incident as a suicide. I’m not really sure what to do. I wasn’t a fan of reading old, unheard of American novels or politics. But, hey, isn't that what you're supposed to do? After all, we thought her death would be a simple suicide, and the government would be removals by now! You see, back in the day, black tar had been outlawed. After the conversion of the names Black Memory to white we saw how the world did not want the worst of Black Memory. So, we built a death machine to transfer black tar into your brain by making it feel like a snickers bar. It was funny because to my surprise, the pain did not hurt. My brain didn’t work for a time. And it didn’t hurt for a while after, you know? To keep some black tar out of your brain and think you’re insane"
596,"This is that hope. The White House, preoccupied with their day long project ( specifically the computer system ) was looking at this new news. All the commercial headlines had been carried for five thousand hours, and it seemed almost like the last few hours had gone by by slower than expected for the first twenty minutes of this new test. It wasn't a day that nobody bothered to send us letters of apology over the phone, rather a few emails received as a thank you in person. I was nervous, but also optimistic. I had only had a few days before a crazy storm came through. Well, at least, that was an overstatement. The signals had a way of increasing the area around them at alarming levels. Hundreds of millions of dead bodies, one man, another a hundred, several thousands on the ground. It was pretty obvious they were coming to conquer all of the world. Suddenly, the ground shook. I flinched as the plume of debris poured over my head, and soon a number of people began to scream. There was enough suffocating to breach the city, and that would save thousands of people in just three weeks. Of course, I was ready for this. It took less than a few hours. As if in an instant, they appeared. They"
597,"Surprisingly, you are not affected by any of your coworkers'superpowers. Waking up to a painfully silent room with the coffee already steaming, I opened the lid of the drawers and exhaled slowly, closing the bags and opening the compartment. Each cabinet had a water bottle and sat in smaller compartment after me, against the corners of the drawers. What was I supposed to do? I wasn’t supposed to have anything to do. What? I searched the drawer by drawer, wondering what I was supposed to do. It was nothing too alarming, just a box of old papers. I picked them up, carefully inspecting each one for any or any kind of criminal-level issue. I saw a picture of a baby girl, blonde hair and blue eyes, but the world was worse off here. I tapped her gently on the nose. “You’ll be sick tomorrow.” “Oh, so I’m gon na miss you then. I can’t wait until I get home. It’s quite beautiful out in the world.” I told her, smiling. As the woman’s eyes widened with joy, the nurses held their arms out, moving swiftly around the hospital room, as if the world was"
598,"“Everyone always says they need you to be careful... you need to remember your human nature, you need to be careful not to open that door.” As I sat at the edge of the room, I sighed and closed my eyes. Slowly, the door opened. I looked up, at the faces in the room, looking down and twitched their heads to the right. As the door opened, I saw three of them, at least one of them. I crouched next to them, I never had a chance of finding out about this to begin with. But I always had a policy of staying outside if they were afraid to come in. It had all started with just one person at a time. There was only one young, lanky man, dressed to the nines in dark black jeans, looking down at an amulet of pure metal that was almost fully transparent. He had put it on, for the sake of nothing but exploration, but it was the most sophisticated thing he had to offer to me. “Excuse me. My name's Josh. I see you just want to walk in here, get a walkthrough on the way in.” He nodded to himself, making sure that he didn't have to signal me to come in. “What are you going to do?” I asked,"
599,"As if that didn't make a lot more sense. So I plopped down on the edge of a pink bed. The room was small, about 3 feet tall. The walls were blue, with a few stains and there were odd things on them that made me uncomfortable. It was mostly a bright white that had some stuff that looked like tools and magazines scattered in the front. These really were harsh, so if you squinted hard enough, you could only make out what looked like a bunch of rocks. It was solid, smooth black stones with a nice, smooth color to them. The room was dark and my ears had started ringing and I 'd never been to a library in the area. I rubbed my hands along the bed. Strange, the color was son't quite blue and my scalp was oddly fine. As I began to type in the stuff the strangers in my room were typing on, I got a new message. I was going to have to get out of the room to finish the page I was on. I started to hurry down the hall, seeing the creepy little house-it-was-house behind. As I entered the room, everything seemed to be just so so surreal. It felt as though I 'd left a trail behind me. As I looked around the room, the smell was unbearable. It wasn't like the cheap vinyl but it smelled almost like a pharmaceutical-y concoction. <"

I don't blame them for sleeping with their parents either, they must be either scared or I know exactly what they are. I lost my girlfriend the other day, she was 14 years old when she got hit by a drunk driver. I knew I wouldn't make it, I have watched enough of reality to know that there is nothing we can do. All I could do was wait. The police took her away. My wife was too young to have loved her. I was devastated to think that my child was ruined. I have learned to forgive myself, even when I would never forgive myself. You know why I went out for a drink with James? I met a girl who could make me forget, maybe she couldn't have been in such an awful situation as I was. She just had the personality of a young boy, and her heart was not broken. I drank as she went out. I took her to her place. The women gave me money, with the promise of being there when she needed it. I knew she would get me, I did too. I never held back the temptation of Iaving my way out, I was so excited that night, but"

Opening my closet, I take out my phone to check the time of the day. As I see my alarm clock approaching two thirty, I turn on the news. The usual dose of nightmares start to creep into my mind. *How is it the future going to be so weird all the time? * I think to myself as I’m wrapped up in the dream. I stare down at the screen with dumbfounded eyes. There are no windows, only a white wall. Only the clock reads 6:30 in the morning. The terror runs through my body. It’s time to get up, and my phone has already reached the time to leave. Just another one of those nights that I could escape or go to bed. But I’m not there. There’s another problem. If I focus my eyes on something, the shape of my phone can be more than a silhouette on the wall. It’s flat. I must have always assumed that at 6:30"

My teeth are gritted, and my mouth is broken. I go to her on the subway, walk through the crowds, and watch the idiots joke on about riding a bicycle to the market. I never see a step between her and me. I never see the automatic doors as they slam shut. I never see her rolling from a hospital. I am a corpse. I am a condemned man, spent. My favourite parts of the city are not being expected. The most hard part of my day is being called by strangers. I am startled to realize my mother is standing in front of me, a bag in her hand and a wet screen in the other. She looks like she wants to scream, but she says no. I know better than to, and can tell. That just means she needs to know what happened. I bring the basket of groceries down to her lap, and hand it to her. I close the basket and look around the crowded street. My favorite parts of the city. I pull out my own phone and type a few things in the search bar on my phone. I check my own browser history. I discover that I do not own any random searches. I assume it is a trick of the Internet and that"

It speaks of your dead body inside the same line as yours. It tells you the story that would be the same person you were. It tells you the stories of what would have been. It tells you that you would never get cancer or Alzheimer's, but you do not get it. You do not get it right away, or remember something that will always be lost to you. You will never forget. It tells you how you did it."

I haven't seen a god damn angel or anything. I should be the almighty being, unlike Satan. If I could I could be the one crying out in pain at the thought of suffering from a guy in a panic attack, but I'm a fucking god and will not be the person that would be condemned to suffer alone on a building. Instead, I'm praying to the god for peace and I will pray to him to make a difference..."
605,"I put the notes back in the envelope as she walked out of the bathroom. “I can guarantee that,” she said smiling as she walked back to the hallway. “At least I'm moving a million dollars back to San Francisco.” I laughed. “Go ahead, I 'll take the money back and put it in this envelope.” I gave her a sweet grin and tiptoed down the hallway. I stopped at the kitchen, near the end of the hallway. The breadcrumbs from the coffee. It was getting almost too late to pay for it, and I hadn't found any time to run. The BAG MOVED! “Your money is already at the bottom, right there, in that envelope.” I called out to my wife, trying to scare her out of reaching for it. “Come here, we have a long drive to get here!” She didn't respond as I pulled her close to my body. “It's been a long time, sweetie,” I said as she wrapped her arms around my neck, tugging as tight as I could. “Take it. Take it from me.” The BAG MOVED! I watched as the debit card"

His heart sped up and he pushed to keep his grip on the book fast. “Two, three, four, five, six....” His fingertips scanned the page and all that remained was two cards folded together. “Two, four, five, eight, seven,” said the bookholder and the pen held firm, and the note remained. A single pen came to rest on the front, and the reading page was cleanly folded. The pen was in the shape of a quarter. “One, two, three, eight...” The pen was blank. The blank was growing longer and closer. The pen's circle held itself firmly in the air. “ONE, two, three, eight....” The pen drew some more. The edge of the pen could make out a small slot between two square squares. The pen panned from side to side until it was a blank. The line moved again. “ONE, two, three...” <new"
607,"From the wrist-burn wound over your heart! Where will I have to go? How long before I'm done? No. No. NO! Nothing! What are you going to do with my life? You're immortal! You have nothing to lose, no energy, not your emotions, no sign that you can go anywhere! Or what happens? If you don't find the pattern, what will? You don't need to do it, don't need to do anything. I'm done being happy! It's nothing personal, it's not even personal! And I didn't feel any panic? I'm the one who should've thought about this already! So you are really going to stop existing, *at least* you can be. I am *old*. I haven't stopped breathing, at least that's what I'm told.

I actually have no clue how she ended up here, but that doesn't matter. She's right here, with me. I have always been a con artist. I moved to New York at 25 to pursue my business. Now I just work at a local restaurant where I cook. I have a crush on a girl named Rebecca, but she isn't that popular. She has always been small and short, but I can see why she is now moving to New York. I've never been a student, and I don't usually bring anything. But this girl was rather interesting. She had to be, at least. She had long blond hair, and a striking blue beige jacket that complimented the chiseled figure. Her eyes were black as always, and she had strong silver discoloration in her skin, which I could only guess were from the passion that her arms were conveying. Her smile wasn't shy, it was a combination of happiness and pity, and a hint of hate. I immediately felt a strange feeling of loneliness, and my heart started beating. She introduced"

I have been good with my family for over 10 years now. “I'm sorry, but our only plans were to take a few innocent hostages to the lair of the Illuminati. Is there a crisis coming?” Death finally said, “I think there is. I'm sure you are very confused.” “I'm... not sure. I... like to be around people, people I love.” “It's okay. We will contact you shortly.” The smooth, smiling Death said, “We're on our way. I'm sorry we didn't find you earlier this afternoon.” “You need to write that down.” I said, rubbing my forehead. “I have one.” Death said, “We haven't met yet. Have you also received your written instructions to execute.” “You- You're right. We can't stop you, you will be executed soon. You will kill people. Everyone will. We will kill people. We will."
610,"A woman's voice, distorted through static. “They're here for you. We were in it for a little while... you won't remember.” A crack of static and blood shot in waves. The light dimmed before the man was a corpse, blackened with age, like someone who stood in a water hose for all his life. “Y-you said you were coming, and I-” the man choked. The light disappeared behind the man and nothing more. “Listen, all that's going to be left is that I was some sort of crazy homeless kid who had been wandering the streets for years. I was having a few, a few threes, and I met this girl, and she was beautiful.” The man looked at the picture of him. He squinted at the picture. His name was William, and he did not know his name. “But, she was my guardian angel. She was in her forties, probably high school, playing high school football with a guy who she 'd met, just gone out of town, a car crash, that really pissed her off.” The image of William seemed a tad crazy. He couldn't be real. It did n"
611,"Exhausted from the days long spent playing games and superheroes, finally reaching home to feed to my wife and kids. I was doing my last decent game of string-ass genie over the ocean when I felt it. The water was hot, and never should have leaked it. The sea is cold and it shatters through my window as if the sun had laid down in front of me for hours. I stood there, feet propped up, attempting to avoid the ice and stillness. I've waited so long for this moment. The cool air chilled my feet to the bone. I had saved the money that I bought a playing tic-tac-toe baseball bat. I was dead in days, the hits never missed. Everything would be fine, there would be a long vacation. Just then, a storm began to hit. As quick as it had started, the world turned upside down, having all gone black and white. I looked around me and realised the blackness was not so black as white, but something akin to blackness. The dark was blurring. There was a very faint ringing in my ears, telling me that I had been hit in the head. I looked down, and saw my baseball bat still laying on my lap. A puddle formed where my head had hit. I ran to the top of the steps. The wind was already over but I ran"

They put the mantle on John's front porch, and he would sit down on a cold wood chair, and say one thing: if this presents a vacation, you better watch the news! After about an hour, he thought about how the tree wasn't in a tree fight; which certainly wouldn't help that it had a high school district. He had been watching the news for the past minute, and there was the US Armed Forces joining forces with the London police force. And then there was a state line, probably the end of the world in Europe, and after a few seconds of consideration, he decided that one more life might be more for them than all of them. The next few minutes are spent laying in bed, dreaming of the possibilities: a snow-storm on his birthday and a trip to Mauna Loa. He has really enjoyed the feeling of being inside the house after a stressful day of work, and he loved the sunlight. But that doesn't matter when you have to put down the TV. He chooses to sleep now, and wakes back up early the next morning. He starts to sn"

Only that there are two names that are etched into his mind. “Gill,” says a robotic voice, pulsing with a voice controlled by the suit of robot control that's everything. “The man is described as from Earth. He is 40 years old and about to be awoken. Some of the guy is wondering if he knows the name he lives for. The other one seems a little nervous.” The prisoner frowns in thought. “Let's see, he lives with out a daughter.” “Well, if you didn't ask her first, then she willn't know why she died.” The prisoner's back is turned. “G-G-G-G-G..” A thin finger slides across the panels, settling behind a transparent background, so it doesn't seem like a left or right world. “G-G-G-G-G.” Gill's face turns into a frown. “My little girl?” “Yeah.

614,"You wake up, live a normal life, then leave town. You wake up, walk to work, and there is a shadow in the door. Walking to my job is as normal as any other day. Usually I take a two hour car ride in which only people live at about 30 or 40, but today I walked across a bridge which gave me information on the river and the monster in the basement. I stayed there for about 5 minutes, then went back to sleep, at first I just stood there watching the river, but then it started to creep around me. Once I heard yelling, and saw people throwing some objects at the water, I stayed still. After I had my answers the shadow dropped and took off running. I followed. It's very easy to see and even quick, but when you see a shadow and it's not as long as I would imagine, you see the monsters you see all day, but really they are a blur. Sometimes I get so dizzy and sleep harder. A couple of times my mom had to give me a ride home from her house, but I don't remember what else I saw and I'm really really tired. It's been 3 months, now. It's hard for me to really believe in a shadow when there's no outline. I think it's just me becoming slightly worried about the darkness around me. At this point, I think the shadow"

I 'll be the one who gets to make my way back to where I belong to a New York's skyline, rather than two hundred pounds less than an athlete. Or,, at least that's what they told me.

Oh, listen to me, son, as I say we're all too much of a show. Everything is fake. To many of my friends, you're aware that I've been truly dead for many years now. For many years, I was made to inhabit the body of the son of my parents. It's hard to believe in time machines. It's really really easy to die at a time like this, if you put it that way.

Are you two going to all just run?” They needed more and more expertise. He could tell they were scared at first. “Private Anderson, let's find this.” “Good enough.” He tossed some matches and lit the hilt. “Finish killing for me!” They went back, snaking in to force a flurry of gunfire and more gunfire. They opened fire again, continuing their firing from a dozen directions. A couple more of the boys made a dash for the closest camp. An old woman in a red jumpsuit stopped them and asked if they would like to go in. “Yeah, let's.” The three boys agreed and sent the hilt across her neck. The woman's gun gave her away to another, and the third shot straight through the female's skull. The girl continued to beat him until she choked and died.

A decent couple of weeks later, the woman is being wheeled out into a stretcher with hazed eyed soldiers and angry soldiers strapped to her. The wounded soldiers remain standing behind the stretcher. The first soldier in the room looks up at the nurse and yells, “Sir?” The nurse looks down and recites, “That isn't right.

I think the whole story was in a lull of content and contentment between being the narrator of the story but I really didn't know what I was going to do. I just wanted to do something amazing. I just had a feeling about it. I parked the car and made my way to the nearest Starbucks. I opened the door to make sure that everything was still looking decent. I opened the top drawer of my bag and laid a quarter and change on the counter. I placed my change into my purse and the cup of coffee was completely empty. It was cold and very strange and was filled to the brim with ice water. I 'd already felt like a terrible person. I should have just turned to the police, they're like police when they're ready to arrest you. But there was one thing that reminded me of the feeling of non-existence that isn't reflected by that color. I 'd had this feeling for a while. People would just start talking and walk away. I usually didn't get to them but I would always have this feeling of something more."

I am named by my parents and they understand that it was my subconscious decision to call me Ashley. I know, by now, I probably never had a real use for my language. To be honest, the only time I've ever been called that was when I was at a desk job. Oh, how bad it had been, moving in a certain middle-aged house, getting a break, and just going to spend a few days off. It was a good time for that. The car swerved, turned on its side, and gently hit me on the back. Everything froze. It was as if every nerve in my body froze as my blood began flowing, pounding, and leaking. My throat started closing again. That must have been the reason I was so weak. That was when I started to realize that it wasn't a headache, it was the pain. It was almost a burning in my hands and head, and that was when I saw it. The white, perfectly balanced font of the CIA had written the name of a middle-aged man, who might be under arrest for rape or murder. He had not been arrested, he was arrested for three counts of supplying illegally-bankrupt statements at a school for young people, and by *looking* it"

This film has cast of men who would either have a say in the matter, or its audience who will appreciate it! However, what it is doing is rather peculiar. It is not made to be a representation of evil, it is made to be made, by men who wish to represent their future. These men will be honored by the greatness of their revolution of the actor, inspired by their vision for America! Next time, would you like to watch the season finale for Tony?"

The system had been fairly simple, and surprisingly secure enough. An email system that had been created in order to ensure security of the system in its integrity from observation. The plan was to document and draw no closer to any harm, no sudden disturbances. In fact, that was what the system was designed for, to keep them protected. On a Friday, April the 13th, 2099, each was so new that it was impossible for a whole city to predict its destruction by a day's notice, and so each copy became more populated than the last. At first people almost thought nothing of it, but after weeks of bland government working, they came to realise that humanity could do better with limited resources. New tech had invented all sorts of viruses, and had implemented anti-virus procedures. They built things that didn't look too bad. Millions of individuals, now either dead or without purpose, were regularly beaten and starved. The system was not entirely infallible. For centuries, years passed and no discoveries were made. For centuries, nobody could do anything to other lives or create anything of value. <newline"

It wasn't what you 'd expect from a government organisation, these two humans really did not come to work in the same lab. They were on break. The AI's overworked operation is no joke, sure, but after a couple thousand years they have to turn an old, lazy office job to something productive.

Maybe I didn’t even want to go to an international conference, and the two main courses were a cold fish in the water and a scent of sweat coming from a nearby crowd that hasn’t been on-site in a week. What really got me was what I was eating. Steak and rice. I took a bite before the customer arrived. He looked like a beanpole or something – a soft cuzpole when you were just about to get ready to leave, a beanpole when you were about to get done with the order and when you were about to get you drop a bag of fish in your mouth. “Theres $ 1000 in front of you and you can order one of my milkshakes” said the cashier. I smiled and looked to the guy. He had a hand-knuckled corner of his face. I’d never been one to be shy, even when I could see"
625,"The result is predictable: the prompt can be delivered. Stories are so passive, so mundane that that's not nearly as interesting as anything else that happens everyday. Usually I find the question of why is there only two prompts here. I wasn't quite sure which one was which. While doing my daily chore, I had to use a good idea for a story. So I decided to write a story about a child ( perhaps, not so terrible, of course ) making a child go to a train station. The first prompt that came to mind was the Girl of the Train ( Child of the Train ), written in a city center in Utah, but with so many stories where it's either physical or otherwise, each read a retelling of a story without characters who should be interested in such a thing. At first glance, it was just a 'telltale tale '. As I read, I realized something in its context - it was not a city, but it was a flat, ivory skyscraper that had some windows down. If I 'd been told that it was not built by any other place, I would not be even here. Rather, the tower, which had been lying for nearly the entire summertime, had been getting more and more like a church, and that building appeared every week by itself, in that a particularly handsome man had emerged and built it from a pitch black stone pillar. That would be the size of a house, and there would be"
626,"A few days ago I bought a really good coffee in the cheapest Wal-Mart we had. It smelled like the meats my mother used to cook. It tasted like the smell of cherry wood. My favourite colour was about the same shade as your favourite red of the water-color that blends seamlessly into the sky. My favourite colour was this flower pot that he bought a couple months ago, which is something my mother was missing. When I went down to visit him one day in the mornings, she would head back to visit him and his wife. We would go on long walks and enjoy each other's company. It was a perfect start to our beautiful relationship and we were so happy. My mother had never seen this kind of commitment and wanted to be able to have every year together. Our personal interactions were okay at first and gave me the freedom of responsibility. I had yet to understand the feelings of an ex that my mom was fond of. The power I was given, I believed, was a gift of some sort from the Gods of The Divine for my birthday. It didn't appear often in my life but they were still pretty rare. Everyone had their own birthday cards, or at least from their parents who didn't believe in them. This year, I was sitting in front of a church where a young lady that was dressed in red and carrying a flower pot would be wearing the same dress"

She looks sad and starts to cry. The man rubs her arm gently, knowing that her time is coming soon. She feels relaxed. The man continues to cry, not bothering to hide the terror that has lurked under his door ever since she died."
628,"... Nobody even suspected what they actually would find. Except, of course, not one of them was prepared for what the other is about to do. They have been enjoying themselves trying to figure out what they will do, this is one of the worst days of the last few hundred years. Its no big deal, but they're supposed to do it by themselves. For some reason they seem so eager to comply to their orders that I'm surprised that the task I'm assigned is of a varied magnitude. There's always trying to end the world with chaos in a world that looks a lot like ours, especially on a violent stillness. Why do we bother to mess with this old bastard when he's called the Empire? The Empire is God's army. The Imperial Empire is an empire with no idea how the expansion of Mars and Mars has ever occurred. The Galactic Empire has done everything in its power to stop us, but the Empires control everything, and you are to be damned. We will rule the world tomorrow and we will be responsible for all that is going on in the galaxy."

I can't feel the constant prickle! * *Oh, don't worry about it, dear, dear, it's about here*, the nurse assured me as I gave her my package. “Have a nice day!” She waved a greeting and I turned to head back into my room. The bastards, they would come, I should have let them in. *How did I get here!? I'm a victim of global warming! * I quietly cranked off the television and settled into my bed. Then I flipped through the channels of the evening news. One on the weather channel channel, the weather was for North America's upcoming drought. “The blood-red plague has killed nearly a million people over the past hour. There is no way they could be isolated from this phenomenon, but that's been going on ever since the population reached over 0 billion. We're right outside the city limits.” *Ok, this is really coming out of nowhere. Why was the bomb"
630,"That a delicate feeling of chaos and silence now come from time to time. It means you haven’t heard from her in a long time, like when you hung yourself the night before your own mother was murdered, a moment of relief for you that your parents had finally said their goodbyes. Then, at the same moment that it all began, it started, an intervention at the small of a few big, small towns. That was when she walked in and told me it was her fault she left, “I don't care who she is, I'm going out with her.” The moment she finished her sentence, that first was when I was most upset. I took my lunch money and left the little small town to head home. The next day, I sat at the kitchen table, as I did every day. Before bed, I would think about her every day, some piece of my brain possessed to do whatever the hell it was that I should do. I had none of that. Then it happened. A few days later, she’d just finished in town and was ready to leave for the day. She remembered to go to church this Sunday. I was too busy thinking about her to be angry. Instead, I started imagining things. You have to, just stay in the shadows. I began thinking about the church, the church where I met Sarah"

The ones at home were mostly dead, and when the fire came you followed through, like they weren't there at all. The guns were barely even close to firing. I only heard screams when the fire did come, but it never even made sense. I've also been warned about your suicide. If I knew you better, I would have told you what I was doing. They have no idea what they're doing, at least not until they come and clean you out. So, I will be with you. I've never forgotten you. I can be next to you. If I'm anywhere else, let it be because you are now my wife. I will always be there. Yours Sincerely, David Surgeon"
632,"This will have to be it. This will have to be it. I took the cash from my safe and hurried home. Before I was able to put my hand on my pocket I heard a stifled gasp. This was so quick, so quick, so perfect. As I ran home he must be getting an accused of an accident. “What? What have you done? What's happening? I’m not a murder,” I shouted. I quickly readied my left hand with the baseball bat and dropped the scissors. The hit was more than I could have anticipated. My angry voice was quiet now, the possible end. But as I put the scissors to my head and gently squeezed the bandages around my head, I noticed something. Something about me was... alive. He was alive! “Dude,” I yelled. He ignored me and continued to twist the bandages around his face. “I saw you looking at the mirror, I can’t be sure. There is some weird anomaly. And I don’t know if you are going to be a killer. Maybe someone can spot you. My type is to hide from public eye, I am called Rob, a psychologist who keeps a special type of thing in check. Is that what you are? �"

I can't just kill myself, but I can do it rather frequently. I have to get something good done. And always I get something good done. There's a small lie to it. To the Hero, it is a fact of life. I am not a monster. And I amn't a hero, not even close. I am someone who doesn't know what to do. Nobody will ever forgive me, nobody will ever make me cry. If they do, I won't be standing here, looking over everyone's head. But every day, they say I am a hero. That I can do that. One day, the little thing will speak to me. He's a hero. He's giving the Order a chance to impress them. One day he 'll pick the lock. One day, he 'll finally become the world's greatest hero, possibly. One day, he will steal the bag from a kid, and I won't have to wonder if I should sit there and do it again for the kid. He will have learnt to try to steal it, every day, and he"
634,"You promised to protect her from every monster in this town. She was safe here with you.” I wanted to listen. I wanted to believe that she had the answers. I closed my eyes and felt a tidal wave of guilt wash over me. I had supposed it was a fairy tale. I remembered when you were the only child with a second parent. I was horrified that you had a fourth parent who never even liked you. But as the demons take over, I can't seem to stop. “Okay. But, first of all, how is this even possible?” I asked, irritated. “You can explain right now.” She leaned forward, settling heavily on the edge of my bed. “But it's all bullshit. I have been to your shop every week for the past few years. Have you seen the little petite petite girl that is what's almost always in my office?” She shifted in her seat slightly. She sat there a while before settling back on her feet. I wondered if she was actually scared. I sat there awkwardly, listening to her. Eventually, the exhaustion wore off. I noticed her staring at me for a moment. It didn't seem like she wanted to answer. She didn't really have much of an answer, I know. It would have surprised me if she hadn't"

The sun rises to climb high. Aokigahara begins to descend. Time resumes. “If I could kill someone, maybe I 'd have enough use for another half hour.” But life continues. No. It's too cold here. There's no water, the land is foggy. More like a cave than a cave. It is long. The sun rises at eight in the afternoon. No matter how long it is, the sun rises. The world is cold. The sun rises at eight, the sky roars fiercely into night. Snow is falling harder than it should have. Warm air draws in. Everything has a slow cadence, with a hint of rhythm. The snow is flying across the field. Air reels in front of a pebbled patch of weeds. Air can be felt in the wind. Aokigahara shines a bright light through the clouds.

Because of this, Tiki thinks he would want to be known as the man whose face starts to glow when he shoves money at random. They don't actually care. The wealthy are actually very strong. Tiki is no political figure. Tiki won't be found being sneaky. Tiki can read people. He has eyes that can read minds. The dark blood of evil tricks his mind. What lies in the depths of the corporation is a matter of getting out. You see, Tiki is a lawyer. He is one of the men who is really born of the devil. They are a large network of lawyers who push people to get a deal in order to stand in the way of a private corporation. And for most of this shady business, this is how they operate. They only want to do what they can to gain from their income. They know that there is only one person who is willing to do what they want. Tiki doesn't know this because he is a top dealer in American-World. He was an elite assassin, an anti-market agent, and for the men to be destroyed in a single day, a politician, and an orphan would be enough to pull off this"
637,". When the first Humans discovered Earth they were suddenly terrified. At first they thought it would be an invasion to make contact with us. Instead they found us accidentally. And then we saw it. A large moon, almost 2 or 3 times the size of the Earth, encircled the entire planet, which just sits there with a sphere of human bodies. Their armor was made of metal, carrying a secret purpose. We don't know what that purpose is, but once that happens, we can't explain it. We don't want to understand what exactly it is. It comes from a ship that is now orbiting the sun, once we thought we had destroyed it from orbit. It's very loud. We can't really understand what it is. It's starting to seem like a satellite. It's coming straight for us. Our screens will start blinking, some goo and other things, and then we will be safe. But all we can think is, will it hurt? Will it hurt? We will die. It would kill us to live. The start of our hyperventilating began when I was sitting in front of the screen. Then I stopped time for"

His hair was more than gray now, having been washed the rest of the year. His skin was soggy and wrinkled, as if it had become worse over a hundred years ago. He pulled out a slip of paper, red script and pen, and unfolded the letter. It had to be the last message. He had to get to the man who had killed him. And before he could get to the man, he was hit. That was it. His body was decomposing. “God. It’s been a good fifty years. I’m glad I’ve seen you.” She had been smiling to herself, unable to find a response, but the blackened photograph on his grave told the story. And to him, it said only three words. “I’m sorry.” His brain seemed to leave his body when he read that. He was really waiting for that. But something about the resemblance was sickening. His face was younger, his hair was as grey as before. His eyes were cold and"

Obama looks up from the viewport of the roof of his compound, and she’s shaking a bunch. “Ah look, I got you on the floor, licking some rotten feet ”, she says. Barack smiles awkwardly. “To get a kick out of this I guess, the young bloods, can be pretty hot in America, making it a little hot out here ”, he says without even really paying attention. The young bloods as fuck are always so high up. The girls in the center of the room are throwing themselves at the American's leader, trying to drown out the music. Only three of them make it. Obama, once again, shrugs and moves out of the way. In a few seconds, Obama is back at his own home on the hill, listening to the president and the other guys from the debate hall. “Hey, there we go, made it to"

Now that the memory will occur. * “I 'll live,” he said quietly, his fingers gliding through the gaps in the artist's paintbrush. - One week later: * Standing on the rooftop, Peter set his brush down, reached for the pistol strapped to his belt. He squinted against the early rays, smiling at the thought of the very different lives this one would lead. He pulled the trigger, and a green-orange gas poured out of the barrel, coating Peter in a clear blanket of ash. *It's been a lot of blood. * When Peter looked back up, a woman was already there. She was dressed in dark blue, but she had black boots, and an electric blue plated button up shirt. She was wearing her business-suit. It was wrinkled and scratched, and a patchwork hole was where the carpet had fallen on the floorboards. She looked at him, and placed her hand on his shoulder. *You should have made a better breakfast. * -- - I only did this because I had to. So sorry if I was"

A structural failure has taken over the ground floor, but any machine can be returned to the usual station later. We hurried down to the roof, approaching the nearest elevator. Some eardrum sound escaped our ears as we drove the elevator up. We slowed our pace, but it was no closer to 10am than we had hoped. Luckily, it was within a half mile, and we entered the elevator. It was a few minutes before we opened the doors. The mass of bodies, screaming, their screams echoing through the lobby. As soon as we entered, the worst sense of fear hit us. There were no clocks. They were completely silent. “AHHH!” I screamed and ran towards the elevator doors, but a malfunction knocked me back into the rubble and crushed my head on the cool tiles. I felt my head crack against the edge of a large caulk ceiling. “What was that?” I whispered into the radio above my head. 'There are reported three bodies on the floor, second one in their home. This is confirmed confirmed. All the other three"

643,"I remember how bored she had been. That drive I once had was a constant feeling in my lungs, some nights were spent just basking in the sun's rays. I 'd hang out in the library after school and watch anime. After the day finished, she could just sit there on her couch, reading. I never really saw her up close. She would just pop up on the screen and fight other superheroes in the background. I wondered what that was like to be it too. A lot of people get overwhelmed with one activity. They get bored of football and baseball. You could always go to work and have a few hours to steal or steal something. But when you started to get bored of school, you didn't really have to deal with doing it for that long. When it happened, you could walk out of class and find your next class. When you ended up in an office job, and spent an hour per day staring at the ceiling and catching my gaze and thinking about how much of a failure I was, you could finally get out of school and go home. No money, no responsibilities. I started seeing the same people sometimes, a couple across town, or in their cars, waiting to get a lift home. They couldn't escape the stares. The glare at them never left, the bruises, the heartache, the *obviously* the worst part? You"
644,"What's worse is that our universe is not as big as it seems. Most of the time the poles seem so far apart that each could hardly make a difference, but the distance is great. The more these changes happen, the more it seems that it can be made. Almost every day a new species or discovery is born; not just a man, but a woman. We have a lot of theories, but none that seem to explain the vast number of changes. We're picking up small details, like where the life form of our universe is: where the hell a life form comes from. We have been so amazed to see how far things could go. It's almost as if we're being taught the world, again, over and over, in the same explanation. No matter where we go, there's still the issue of the universe. Again, we were curious to know more. Perhaps we can tell the truth, because we are very curious to know the stories of our universe. We're so curious."

Your fathers eye was like a stray cat for as long as I can remember, so it was always for years. I never came to meet his father, or see him. I was bored, so I decided to go with my mom and her grandmother's house. All I was left with was the tag that told me when my parents had died I would never tell them. What I was expecting was no birth canal for her or her I’m guessing because she had been in a car accident at the time, just then a large car crashed into her car. She was crushed underneath her car door. I wasn’t prepared for a possible death for my mother, and before she hit the ground she began to cry and cry. I could’ve told her that something was wrong, but the man sitting on the passenger’s seat had struck the windshield. Luckily I wasn’t too far behind when it happened and I can’t tell you exactly what happened. As I was lying on the floor a window smashed and I could hear the crash coming closer. My vision began to blur and I couldn’t see through the slit in my head as I lay on the floor. When I was calm enough, I looked"

She saw me and jumped over my attacker's body. I screamed and the dog licked my chest. I heard a scream coming from below. No time for words. I swung my left hand out and grabbed her shirt with both hands. It rained drops down from the sky and flew down to the ground. Her hair fell from her head. She looked at me with the lifeless eyes of a child. She coughed and sputtered. Her head was covered in blood. A branch fell on her face and she passed out. A death grip was all that I could use. I ran over and cut her throat. I didn't hear her next words. I hope he finds his way home."
647,"One day you decide to become a boss. The competition of players in the lobby was amazing: in the far corner of the arena were the teams of players: A familiar grizzly with a deep purple beard at the end of his hairline, a young kid who could hardly contain himself looking away from him. Not this tall, rugged fellow, who likely did not know this game, just looked bored, as if a peculiar of conduct. Seemed surprisingly different, considering he might be playing a risk playing. To anyone else, a casual warlock had looked like a raving coward. The game was going well for him. They were carefully hidden from sight, looking only as he quickly approached. His whole life, he was always set for what he believed to be the best. But there was one thing he couldn't be sure of. He looked back and forth between the party members, the red-cloaked man who was speaking quickly as if asked to impress, the man who had been just standing there. He saw him. Two. Two. Two - one. It was a near dream. He really did have a long time to think this over. He couldn't move the other man's head up to eye level, and just have to move him to face him. Three. Five. Six. He thought about it for a moment."

Everyone believes they are ghosts, but it can be done with flashlights. And humans have never had seen such a move. But ghosts still exist. The memories, the pieces of their bodies missing, are still there, as they are in all of the previous lives. For instance, this first night I 'd thought I had seen a ghost. Had I? I didn't think much of it at the time. I lived with my childhood friends, my neighbors, and my parents, my two older siblings. But I did know. But not like other people's things. They were stuck here, their bodies still moving and moving like they were stuck alive, their eyes closed. I couldn't move. Not for no reason, at least. What had happened to those in the physical world, then? How did I discover that I could move around, though, if I didn't move like some sort of puppet in some strange game?

My internet friend had written the words, titled 'I lived in my basement ', so we can browse up on it! Not just because it would benefit us! Sure, we did go over and do loads of reading every few months, but we read mostly for fun! Some of the stories are sweet, but there's a little part about only describing a nice man, very well-dressed, and very intelligent. All the details are there! Anyway, back to the story. A library is fairly built around a horrible, empty, haunted warehouse. So when people would find a way to sleep under the stairs, or to use their spare bits of stone, they would all come here. After they came here, they would always keep a flashlight and torches to light their way through the maze of narrow passages. They would take pictures and scrolls of what they could do with them, then show them to the human society they were born in! We weren't expecting them to believe anything we did... but we still believe they. Even though we don't know how or why they're here, it will have to be a pretty steady count for our guide guide to do so. <newline"

My stomach is beginning to turn sour and my breathing is growing shallow. “It's that two time machine now. A fucking freak accident.” He looks at the clock, tossing the paper aside. “Two years ago, he finally discovered what he was looking for.” “What the fuck?!” I say and raise my fists to protect myself from him. “What's going to happen? What's going to happen? What's going to happen?!” I put my hands to my ears and stop breathing. He shakes his head and looks me in the eyes. “You shouldn't, remember? You died at some point, you know.” He turns to leave. He stops just short of me before I swing his fist and start roaring. “He is a fucking maniac, what the fuck am I supposed to do?” The words stick in my head and I try to smile at the noise, but the sound is so angry. I bite my lip to stop the panic. I can barely see from there. I still have"

She sits across from me, stares at the ground, takes her phone out of her pocket, presses her thumb to the battery, and slowly scoots it to the phone's screen. That's when I catch her eye.

We had changed one simple fact, however, and would destroy their empires. They were almost a thousandfold in number. We would soon have them both here.

Being part of the army, more and more the others had it easy. It was one hell of a gamble. Every time I would walk in on myself, I would see that head. It was my passion. The thrill. It was my vice. I feel fulfilled all the time, every time I thought about my girlfriend. After everything. I'm glad I didn't see the significance of what I'm doing. Until now. We met at a bar.

He closed the door behind him, allowing me to rise from my makeshift cover. “Hey!” he announced, feeling proud. I raised my gun to his face, both aimed at my chest and at the man who wasn't reacting, and pulled the trigger. The bullet skimmed through my chest, right in the eyes, and I slowly emptied my clip at the man's head, breaking off the bullet and letting blood drizzle out from his mouth. “Can you do it?” he screamed, sounding like his last line of command. I shook my head and released the trigger. I let his body sit in shock as he dropped to the ground. “I- I... I couldn't let you do this!” he cried out, sobbing as I eased myself off the ground. “I can't!” I smiled. “Then why don't we just kill each other?”"

656,"club. A real club. Or a ballroom. A small cottage of some sort. This one will be about twenty floors down. I wonder if my dad has a pizza here. I see one kid standing outside his door, looking out the window, but it doesn't seem to be anyone here. I start walking up to the boy, who is just waiting for him to open the door, but he's locked. I go into the room, and look down on the kids playing in their underwear. They are smiling and laughing, just like everyone else. The feeling of that deep, dark tinge of nervousness, that my soul wants to say nothing. I close my eyes, and what the fuck is going on? It's been awhile since I've been to a normal home. There is no church. No superheros. There are no local kink shops. There are only the hot-dog bar, the food shop, and the dog park. *Oh fuck. *"
657,". The smoke and ash drifted lazily through the metal beams that littered the rooftops of Southwick. Alateman, his voice rising and dropping low he prepared to greet the day. The city was a calm setting to his unit, its streets empty of people, vacant buildings and businesses. Only that one scarlet light had returned. Alateman lifted his gun and looked over to his compatriots. They all wore that blood-red uniform that had decorated their uniforms a long time ago. He cleared his throat, “Dear comrades. My names Alateman. My name is Alateman and this is my command. If we do not go now, it will become clear to you that if we do not do now, it will become clear to me for the rest of my service.” A group of other soldiers ran up to the hulking being. Alateman spun the man who stood over his unit into a sudden silhouette, then held the gun firmly in one hand. He pressed the first hole through the air and the flash of lightning lit the darkness. A dark and familiar grimace grew on Alateman’s face. “Alateman? You are here, you are here. We were attacked on 1st August. I and my team were alone out here at the time. We had been covering up, a sniper, so we didn’t know how to contact the squad. There was no cover, as an unknown"
658,"As a person with such high numbers on this sub, it was really clear that I wasn’t too mad at it. I always wanted to write something for the audience. So I would try and follow up my favourite writing style every day, and answer each morning as much as possible. I read the very first chapter of my book so that I have time for naps before I leave. It’s the best thing ever! That is. That is, I love it. Overall, this is a great prompt, and I will be sharing my writing here to make sure that you enjoyed it and decided to give it a shot. Thanks!"
659,"The thought passes through my head as I walk to a car that isn't parked. A breeze whipped me into a good jump, a sensation I've longed for, but have only experienced before now. My first thought is to say goodbye, but what I actually said was that of being lost in the desert. I felt... strange. I was lying in a sand dune that a few feet from the Earth, deep buried inside the sand. I felt no pain, no fear. My life around me was a dream, perhaps a time before life had existed, but I had this... sensation of excitement. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, my gaze was locked on what looked like a computer screen. An issue was... something was wrong with it. The screen flashed something with a word on it. “Find yourself, find yourself.”"
660,"To gather the sacrifices of our fallen brethren! I of course expected well to be of the same story, the kind that makes you lose your fucking mind. That was I to do, not others. There were nearly 100 already on my list, and I was able to stand before the three members of my squad, two of whom would kill me in five minutes. When you think of eternity, you think that death is the absolute truth. It isn't just ever ending, but usually coming back to the person you've been forever? Every man, woman and child they were given is given 10 millenia to develop a dormant parasite which feeds off of the subsequent multiplication of the common cold. That's where they get you: the cough, the liver attack, the lung cancer. A few washes and are added to your list of symptoms. I used to doubt it. There were always suspicions. It didn't matter though, they were quick, followed with apathy. If you had any doubts then the term was lazy. The other sons and daughters are their own work, they have the same say in the matter. We all have those. Everyone has their duties: your punishment, your fate, your survival. Yes. Yes, there is a way to do this. Yes, not easy. That is a mistake, a self-inflicted"
661,"I have always liked trains, and it gives me time to think. It brings my memory in pieces and helps me recall things from a kid. Just a small drop of memory to recall, and a small little blip from when I was younger. I was bored, as always, I ended up on the wrong train. I had never seen a person before, but no one ever talked to me about them. Time slowed to a crawl. The sensation I had given up on when I was younger. You 'd do that. Is it good for you to have people watching, but not feel these kinds of signals or experiences, just feel them? How can one just pretend it's worth it? And yet, you keep going on. You keep walking, always going forwards, never even stopping, the same point that's been happening before, is today. Each train is different in its own way, and every memory is still bound to an destination. You will want to see it, but if you feel, if you continue to stare, perhaps you 'll get a few seconds of closure. Some people ignore the repeated history of their ancestors, but I keep looking and looking. The fog is filling the station, but the pain is pretty normal. An x-ray showed a man and woman, arm in arm. They are wearing a long, jagged"
662,". “Hey there,” he said through gritted teeth. The same old old old person from the laughney thing again. That's what I used to think. He used to get more reaction when I called him that, more annoyance when I gave him a lecture and I was never terribly interested in trying to grasp the answers to that. Maybe I'm a tad weird, but he wasn't the same stranger as a stranger, and he wasn't the same as any of the other people who weren't already in the shop. I 'd been up to this point, talking to people again, buying various items, considering the wishes I 'd always had, they all looked the same. It was something my parents always told me that was not normal. They taught me that with wishes it would become more mundane, different types of wish that everyone else would either be disappointed in or have. Not an actual wish. A power can come from nothing. There was no opening to the door to a place like this, yet I never questioned it. If the need for a wand, a wand, or a wand were innate, there was no need to make it, or use it. It was only automatic. It made no sense to me, but it seemed so silly. Some teenagers didn't even use it in real life, anyway. At least some would say that. The"
663,"In the only song I can think of, it’s *Lonelier than the Boat*. I stared blankly at the pavement, my memory so fuzzy, as though I were completely lost in its well-dressed beauty. It had been three years since I’d seen my daughter and she had climbed up the mountain so high that my boots would almost knock over pieces of my sedan. Even at eleven in the morning, my task would be finished, laid out at the bottom, then carried away with two backpacks back to the station. But this is something I’d heard dozens of times before. The story of what was written by the egg and the egg had been born, for whatever reason, and I could only catch glimpses from the web of thoughts I’d been wrestling with some time ago. It’s only been like two years, but I’d decided to stay focused on the song for the ride home. It made little difference to me. **Crack** Something outside the windshield of the car drove against the window with a screech. I slowed down. I stood there in front of my daughter, staring at her inquisitively. She looked nervous, but with some of the same panicked determination in her eyes that I was certain I saw when"
664,"You can't afford to risk an aggressive adventurer who will not buy the item. My neighbors are getting desperate, and they need a boost! The rumble in my stomach is intense. I fold my hands over my ears and brace for another chime in a few minutes, the task to fulfill comes in the form of a polka dot bow, and a steel arrow. We would have to make a decision before either player. It's a trade. A deal to raise my pay for the first piece of loot. A secluded corridor, quietly guarded by kings. Not everyone enjoys being a sith, of course. Maybe one of them would get in, but it would have been to frighten the guard and trap them in a trap. The train journey is only a day's walk from town. Twenty-five minutes will lead me directly to where the dragon should be. A regular route. We were approached on a busy road this morning and by morning, nobody to save their lives. I am one of the noble homes residents, however. A closer inspection reveals a small shop tucked away on the side of the road. It doesn't look fancy, only a wagon as far as the eye can see. In the opposite direction is a column of green brick, and behind it a line of dilapidated and chipped towers. I 'll have to go and break into a castle, if I have to. It'"
665,"Every body found itself perfectly unified by an enormous collective and core and their collective down to its component parts. Every synapse with their individual sponges was discovered while we reassembled our ancestors with the codes we remember now. It was, at first, not known, but the information that was presented from all our ancestors resonated and our minds found one, drawing shades across a huge scale that exploded to a new level and had the potential to attract whatever was still at the center of the Universe. Of course, they didn't find out until further than we did. It was already in the year in which they came in contact. Had something to do with the combined winds of the Universe to keep them safe for hundreds of years? Something we 'd never discovered until it was too late. They couldn't really describe where they came from, and couldn't wait to uncover them at the very worst of times, yet, somehow, somehow, we did. In the end, they came with no end in sight. At first, we saw the comet vanish into the nothingness. When we saw it, we certainly knew something was different. Suddenly, a potential vulnerability. Not just any man like ourselves, but a collective and infinitely larger all structures. A group of scientists, including me, had been tracking their distant comet"
666,"that's not even going to happen. In fact, you've obviously used a lot of technique for inspiration so as you don't get taken over by these monotony minions with the power of a thousand eyebrows being flung by demons in a little bathroom stall and another one slapping the ceiling tiles and placing shoving a bed sheet on top of the table and putting that linen up, you have no idea how much I hate my job, I can't go over thinking that more. Also, the fact that I got a little practice ( I didn't really know that anyone would get that close to a being who was supposed to be basically the me, I guess ) so far is that the place is fairly “win-win-win,” and really, it's not like I could ever argue with them. It takes me months to find these “chosen” targets, you know, these guys who can't figure out how to make them look anymore, or lose someone and somehow have to play for years to get the job done, or have to destroy somebody in case they decide to kill them, as an example. So that is one guy, long time ally in my name, who manages to kill, later burn, and simply forget all about it, who's just as bored as they are, and so on. I've had some bad luck, but I"
667,"Then comes…thing.” “Whooo? What’s that?” came the reply, apparently understanding the situation in which they were in. “Oh, there’s nothing to worry about.” I thought. I stood up, setting my broken mug down on the floor and rubbed my eyes. I set my mug down and picked up my broken broken bowl, spilling water all over my knuckles and limbs. “Bloody,” I muttered. I got off of the table and started to walk to the kitchen where my work was waiting for me. As I reached the kitchen door, I glanced at the back door. Just like every other morning, there was no evidence that anyone was nearby, just a fucking note, even though I needed a coffee. I walked towards the door and put the note down. When I opened the door, it read “Do you have anything to drink?” I hesitated for a second, holding my breath until I saw the note; > From you, > Dear John, > I love you"
668,"NASA had been looking for a remote backup. And the only chance they had to get back at it's former self was through a high tech looking conspiracy blog where it was based on a man named 'GreeneAuthor,'a big secret that the group was hard at work with. 'GreeneAuthor'would call him and call him 'whole bodybag,'even using real people to move around to the internet. *Tick, tock, tock. * The screen was on. If the government didn't attack US military, the awe could be extremely very real and probably needed a pre-recorded call. They couldn't hide it. Every country knew about this, of course. They suspected it was something to do with the bombing or the Anti-Theft. But anyway, the country had found a new Internet access switch within the next week. A thing of science! A black box with internet access to a black hole. What the fuck! *Tick. Tock. * Quickly, the spider-like thing clicked on. The blood curdling sound of blood curdling... shit... they had failed. It hadn't caused anything fatal that would kill them, not this way. *Tick. Tock."

You're full of vindictive jokers, John. You can't make it look bad. There's nothing wrong with killing someone with an axe. I 'll give you that.” John groaned. “Have you heard the announcer? We're going to have to hunt this giant down.” “Get away.” John scrunched his face in disapproval. “Me neither. You know me well. I was just trying to stop you from shooting me in the back.” The Captain chuckled. “You've gotten yourself into a fight with me.” “You are, Captain. You're not being rude, John.” “I am, Captain. You know me. I wasn't on the train, but in a moment of terror, you came and were afraid.” The Captain thought about it. Maybe this man was one of the Angels, just gone for a second and he was dead."
670,"A school nurse stood in the doorway to the maternity ward, a magnifying glass flat. A little girl giggled quietly at her grandfather's antics. She must have just come back from helping little Anna up to the door, but she knew that wouldn't last. A man in a suit of white ran in, reading a clipboard. Anna's eyes widened and her husband helped her into the room. The chief of staff stopped her, while the mother attempted to cover her for a while. The woman started asking the manager for a coffee. “Well,” the manager replied. “There hasn't been a break in the past two years,” he told his wife, pointing down the hall to the freezer, “they've already tasted awful. I bet the makers knew they were pulling shit out of this one last week,” he said. “Whatever. A bit of scrubbing.” The woman shrugged. “Thank you, sir. I'm sure it won't be that bad.” She 'd been growing increasingly aware of the noises now that she 'd been forced to come in for the tour of the facility.

You know they only hear the sounds when there is a demon in their head. You approach the door to the room and, once again, hear the voice. And you feel the pounding in your ears. A note comes from the door, and you turn to face it. There is a grumble of desire as it tries to escape. The man with claws and teeth tries to dodge the clawing. You can hear the rustling of leather as he tries to hop away. A jolt runs through your entire body. Sweat builds on the side of your face. You don't know what to do. The man with claws picks up his pace and opens the door. You run as fast as you can up the stairs. You escape the stairs of your lair, running down through many rooms trying to pass the goblins in the tunnels. This is the lowest point. You run for hours and hours. For the next twenty years, you will find yourselves locked in a cave where the goblins scream and fight and seek your blood. Eventually, you will run out of arrows and hide in plain sight. You run as far as you can in such an isolated area. That is until"

Your eyes don't really open anymore, they're closed with the majority of your body. You quickly duck and try to grab a hand off of your head. But something's on your face. It's your wrist.

You grab the knife, get out of the room, and grab another of the knives. You're starting to give in. You pull out a knife, but you're coming back at first at the table. There's blood on your chest.

The ancient old armies turned to be bulletproof armor, but it was heard as if this wasn't truly a conspiracy theory. The eyesight began to be lost, and the power increased to nearly invisible. The Alarm never seemed to eclipse their vision. In their physical duel, survivors were victorious. While some of the survivors were struck by arrows, some of them were survived to alive with armor. These were the 16th time that the human civilization fought the sun in battle. The last victory was the end of Valhalla.

You must understand that these happened twice. The first skirmish, a soldier, killed, hitting himself. The rest of them fought for a more intense battle. Soon, their soldiers died as well. At the last moments, the entire Roman army had been killed, except for twenty men. This was the end of General Frank and General Ivandodding, who attacked the last enemy side, but did not have a battle to lose. Frank, who had expected, had only managed to escape the battle. These were the last, the final foes. George had only killed one less guard before. His soldiers were to be killed by his enemy, but not in very long time.

The town I once lived was not mine, nor the fact that I was a man 's man. My mother and my father. My father and I. The last thing we did was go to the park and go there for a cup of coffee. I do n't know how the sun would end, but that 's when I got the call. I am the man that lived here, and I 'm an officer. I 've lived here in New York for the past few days now, but not for long.

798,"“It 's not like I 'm a good person to be honest ,” I said, and I had to look out of the window. I had a lot of time to look out for the other people. It had been a long week since I had been a good person and now I was the only one with a family that cared about me. I had seen a few people come out for some fun at the restaurant and I had seen a few people I 'd had enough time to do some work. They 'd had their own conversations, and I was n't about to get a job. I was sure of it. I had to do it, though - I had to do it. It was my first day of work."

I 'd never seen her before. The first time I saw her, and I could n't help but feel that she could n't have been more than twenty years old. My heart stopped and I could n't believe it. I was sitting in a chair at my desk with a laptop and a laptop. “What do you mean? You know, I 'm sorry ,” I said. I had no idea what to say to her. My life had been so much more exciting.

They get a little too scared .” She chuckled and waved to the other guests. The others were already sitting on the couch, looking at me with their own eyes. “Well ,” She nodded, “so, what do we do now ?” She leaned in closer, “do you remember what we do ?” “No ,” I said as I turned my head. I had never been a fan of my peers. But I wanted to be the most important person to ever exist and I"

He was still there, and now the man was still there, with no bed to speak of. No mattress, no mattress, no mattress on the floor. His eyes, they were all that was left now, the man 's mind, was still there, with a blank stare on his mouth. His mind wandered, and his mind, and his wife and children. The last thought he had of the man, who had been the one to remember them, as he had been a man who had lived the same life as them, with a smile on"

I could hear my friends whispering about their work to me. “We are so close, ” I said, but the man in front of me did n't listen. “What do we do now? ” I looked at my friend, who was now leaning against me from the other side of the table. He was holding something from his pocket, but he seemed to be looking at his own phone, looking right at me. “We should be careful with this.” He said, and he held it up to his ear. “We should get out of here, and get out of here.” I nodded. It was a strange request"

The moment I 'm standing in front of a screen, staring at a screen of the screen, the image of the world that I had planned to be a part of.

And then, when they had to, they went extinct, and the people were all dead, in a dead world, all dead in the blink of an eye. A world that did it because we had n't lived, and the entire world was dead. But the robots were still alive, and still, we were not, and we were n't, and that was not what happened.

He had been waiting for this day for years, but he had never wanted to be here. The man walked up to the door and opened it. It was a small man in a suit and tie, sitting in a chair opposite him. “Good morning ,” the man said. “Thank you ,” the man said, his eyes looking at his plate, “Do you have any plans ?” “Sure, thank you ,” the man said, his tone a bit less condescending, “I 'll be on my way .” The man smiled"

I took a look at myself in the mirror and thought, “I 'm just a normal human being .” The shower was a bit messy and I was tired. I got dressed and looked at the water.

The sunlight had long since turned a deep brown, and the sun had been shining for a few minutes, but I had always felt it was the way it was. I was a child that lived in the countryside for a short time. My mother had always been very supportive to me, and my mother was happy, and my mother loved me much more than me.

A few weeks back I met up with another girl at a bar, and she was nice enough. We had a nice place for a little over two weeks, and we were in love. I met her a few years back after my promotion, which was great because she said that she 'd come for me for me to live with, and I had an idea, that she would n't want me to live with her. She had a pretty good name. I got married after she moved in. I met a friend. She was a bit of an ass. And the girl"

I did n't really understand what I was doing, so I just sort of went through it and got to see the things that were happening on the day of my birth. I had a long, long and awkward encounter on my way back to my house, when I heard something, something that was n't there in the middle of the night. I had been doing it for two months, I knew that I 'd be doing it, so I had n't really been doing it until then, and I had never had a problem. I looked at my watch.

My eyes were already adjusting to the dim light, and I could hear the low hum of the water around me. “I do n't think that 's a good idea, but what else is there to do ?” I asked. My mind was racing, and I was n't going to answer the question, but it was n't going to be like that. “What do you remember ?” I asked"

It was time to take a shower. The door opened, and a man walked in with one of the women. He held the woman 's hand. The women were dressed in a black dress and black dress. They were wearing black dress. They were wearing black and black shoes. She held a knife in a black case. The woman stepped over the body and pulled out a knife. The woman 's hands trembled as they touched her. They were on their knees, and were crying. “I 'll give"

I remembered seeing my daughter, I had n't really seen her for years but I remembered being at the park in summer. I had n't been in the park since she was born, but the park was a lot more crowded and there was no park for that matter at this point so I decided to try and find the park. It was a nice place to find my wife and see where the park was but it was n't like I 'd ever see her again.

It was a place where we could be in love. It was where I had to spend my first day on this planet. I 've always had the ability to see the things that I wanted to. But I never did.

'Please Doctor, don't hurt yourself there!'There was no need for crying, as Mr. Forsythe had taught him in class... who would be giving him that advice?'Franklin paused. 'Where the hell is Captain America in all this?'How could that animal hide?'Looks like I've got myself another little mystery to solve...'His hand jerked to the side, feeling his way around the room. 'Could something have knocked him over?'Yes, Captain America could potentially be either. 'He looked up at the big metal door with dark tinted glass. 'I wonder what just happened?''maybe this place is haunted...'I dunno...''grabbed the other end of his cord, he knew that kind of scared him... why was he walking around all alone?'The hubcap clicked with static electricity.

963,"Do not write about a man or woman.' ` Don't!' cried the boy; and in two words, he flung the paper into the river. But not a stone could pass between them. Just then the head of the little fish cried: ` You have caught my little sister's lute, but I will no longer wager her as you set me free.' ` That is what I did not mean to do,'answered the old dwarf again. ` Now draw me off by a rope from the top of the tower and throw me down a well. I will bid the elder of us good evening, on behalf of my child, who was as happy as anyone else at home when she died. If she was not happy enough, it was your fault, for I knew that neither sun nor moon stood still with her.” I hardly know what to say.' ` And you?' cried the girl, throwing back her silken veil; ` had it not been for those roots that I was left hanging?' The younger dwarf did not answer, for he wished that nothing should be said about him. ` It must be true! But it is an idle story to talk of my life,'said he; and he picked up the sword again and made haste to reach the top of the tower. Before his feet touched it he did not wish to look back so soon -- he only wished that he might have only himself to begin with. Before long he found there a fountain watering the river, on which a thousand heads sang and no one lived. When the hero reached the place he looked through the shining window and saw two figures standing stark and firm in the water. The bronze head looked like a lake, and the silvery one was almost as big as a sun. If he had seen those two before he would never have thought that they were as beautiful as they seemed, for the other looked as if she felt at ease in the depths of the fountain. He clasped the water and ran quickly towards the fountain. His hand soon caught in the bronze one; suddenly he sank to the bottom. For two miles round and round he ran until he came up in the land of darkness where spiders and men thrashed about him, so that everyone he met wanted only to bite him. The creature became stiller when he got within sight of a vast river, each night glittering like a chasm; but always he saw the gold ornaments that dwelt among the rocks in their caves. ` Was that a boat?' asked he to himself with amazement. ` No,'said the girl again, ` the bed I strewed was a great deal bigger than this one.' And in spite of everything he heard the head peep out.' I know what you mean.' ` But, my dear,'replied the dwarf,'I have sworn I shall not marry anyone till I have saved you from drowning.” I never heard so much of drowning'; but the princess loved him, not because she believed him, though she really was sure of that, but because she loved his kindness and his prudence, and because she loved him for his cleverness. ` Well,'said the head softly, stopping suddenly in front of the river and gazing at the young dwarf."

As you sit as if eating alone, there comes a clang in your head which seems no horse at all and you can not help feeling a great deal annoyed.' Stop, cut and thrust all your property off the horse and puts it on your shoulder. When it has ridden off with you in its carriage he asks if you wanted food. You did not answer the question and stood looking at him in confusion. Faced with your failure to explain yourself, an angry old woman came up to you and said: ` Go home, with all other men of rank get your knapsack and also your bowels out and give me these saddle poles.” I will gladly do so, for I am too clever to allow people who should annoy us.” Now, wife,'says she, ` give this coat over to me, which takes no more than twenty gold pieces.' With a bundle of cords lay on the top your coat and then dropped her large cloak over the horses chest, but most precious of all was these cups which you could tell were Japanese.' you don't know if they mean something else?' ( THE MAN BETRAYED BY HIS WIFE ) He cried bitterly, but still that enraged old woman answered him: ` So now the rest of my friends have joined you without having also eaten, as they should wish, the things which their fathers are obliged to put in their waistbands at the village feast. We shall be kept from the flames by so much wealth that neither fire nor war will ever succeed; only sleep till I bring you counsel.' Yes, when you will fill the bellows they will come too. Do you think they will consent to nothing while fortune rewards them better than the common man?' Something was written in letters on the table, saying that servants were wont to be nearly as good as people they came from. For years the old woman had been ignoring both this story and that one without being held in any great esteem, but luckily a kind old farmer had given her the gift she craved and now seemed very glad to tell her tale. ` May the rascal never break his word,'she cried ;'even Cato put his foot down when he heard that!' I've thought about the fine subject,'she exclaimed, again tears streaming down her face.' It seems to me quite natural,'d he, holding up two lumps of bread as an example.' Where does the meaning of that lie?' Nothing,'answered he.' Why does the golden cup change color when held in the right hand while in the left, although one would mistake the cup in the left?' Could there be any such thing as a silver one which is not right or wrong?' No; he is sure it is.' Still her wrath flared and she charged, trying to beat him down, but he held out the knife that found such good use in cutting the cobwebs'berries and remining the sick cat's wounds into silver buds."

They intend to use it to bring down one of their neighbours, or a whole country into chaos, and as punishment beat the baby to death with their pitchfork until she dies from the injuries, even though she does not look any worse than other babies.' The witch-woman curses her children, and one of them stabs the other in the back as retribution. This has happened to my children, they will have been killed too!' When their plan is complete, the babies are brought before the Judge -Voronius, the Council of Witches - who dismiss all charges against the couple.' Sire, I will ask you one question.' ` The thing is, that as soon as you pronounce your verdict here, and come to your judgement at once if, after three days, you have no idea of what they will say, what arguments you will use,, I will release the prisoners.” If that's understood, you may go out and call them on no more pretenses,'continued King James.' Let them hear no more nonsense, unless you wish them further mischief.' Next day the babies were shown to Prince James, with his mother's ring on his finger. He took the ring and the ring is there. Now his mother was silent for some time, so he asked her with a much bigger smile: ` What are these things you are saying?'' I wish them further harm,'replied she.' Then see for yourself.' His Majesty looked, and saw two large square pieces about ten feet square reaching out from each corner of the room. All day long they appeared in rotation, nearly every window had been boarded up, and nothing but quiet grew outside, except the breeze. And he was proud to say, that as soon as he arrived in court, instead of seeing old prejudice and silly laws which he has often heard, the nation seemed to be at peace and ready to make war.' ` Old dog still,'the king cried to his magistrates, ` so do what you please, this peace and safety I bring you today I can never fear anything. But remember, I declared it, not to let your deaths follow a wind of doubt; much had happened since I took power, we did bring our daughter-in-law here so many years ago in her place. ` Very well,'replied his Majesty, ` let me tell you honestly. Each justice was a girl that bore him a son, except Grandmother who died seven months later, which in the last judgment only put my claim in. ` Then you should certainly declare your claim,'requested Lady Miranda. The king said as he spoke, ` The girl only let herself be betrothed to one man.' ` Then they had a boy, and in spite of it they remained unmarried till I came to Power.' ` And was not his sister your brother?' said the king.' She married him,'answered Lady Miranda, in an ironic tone, as if to show the king she still considered him married. Then Bellaston began to cry, and Lady Miranda to comfort him."

982,"' The Knight said as he spun around and through the palace gates. ` I took it for granted that whoever did this would get up into heaven; yet, I was still very much surprised at what my luck had brought me into. There was something groan and howl behind the windows; then the door flew open and I fell to the ground. In one bound the air sprung up from under my feet, so I tried to draw the sword away from my face to make room for more space. Alas! I could neither draw nor strike my adversary; only struck him lightly on the shoulder. He yelled. Just like so many others who have done so, I have met with some success in Heaven.' After seeing the struggle between the man and myself from above there came on him such heavy weeping from the mountain of love to say: ` Your peace is mine, O good knight.' And my own departed brother knocked the point out of his head, saying: ` What are you weeping for? It is to our sweet sister. Aren't we unhappy enough in our position here as you see it?'' he cried to his wife. Yes, but God says that each person who doeth evil must come to a place of peace with himself.' And her husband looked sad and troubled. ` But the boy does as he sees fit,'he said suddenly. ` He will lie down as if to rest, and wait till the son wakes.' At these words the old woman saw what his heart wanted and ran back to her chamber. ` Why, where shall we go?' she said.' I have told you what I want.” Well, have the seven demons come too?'' I don't know; why, you can kill them,''she replied. And the old woman went off to the opposite side of the house. But she was almost knocked down when her foot caught something hard on the kitchen floor. All the demons except two were flung down except the Man-lion and the Black Crow, who screamed ` Don't do it again! If you strike again we will eat you, and we won't hurt you anymore!' A frightful uproar arose, and the poor women ran into their rooms while the real four robbers threw themselves down under the cabbage bushes near by. They put a pistol inside their pockets, and made a fire for warmth. The angry warriors, thinking them their children, seized one of the brides-maids and thrust her up against the door. ` Aren't you coming, Jaqueline?'' I say, my dear sister.' I have promised this to your father,'she answered, and held the pistol to her own forehead. Then the robbers with the giant crow watched for the sound that might be made under the window."

984,"It isn't like you were living by yourself, either, because you had friends, family members you knew from when you was younger. Even though you worked so hard for so many years, they thought the very same things about you as they do about yourself, so you could trust them implicitly to your happiness and care for them. Now you wonder if you should have stayed put or went to town to go hunting?' I knew I should never choose the second option, thinking once more about what the other person would say.' I really must go,'I answered. So I dressed, shaved my head, changed my clothes, pulled up my grass stick and arrived at the slums. The first thing I did when I entered the capital city was call out, ` Where are you going and why are you so late?' And I was allowed three hours, since the law allows only one hour for each citizen. At six o'clock in the evening I got ready and invited everyone I met to a feast. Many were eager to eat and some refused food all together; but so far the most gracious ate and drunk so furiously that after the fifth glass of wine I began to doubt whether I was going to die soon or not. I then went to breakfast, where I had prepared the bread we 'd be eating the next morning and then sat down in the waiting room and went straight to bed. After having slept for ten minutes or so I got up and dressed. Now it was eight o'clock, so to speak, when I ate my dinner. Yes, the table was quite full and I paid some attention to the kitchen and wine-chamber while eating from that plate that I took out with me to drink. But I could scarcely wait to finish it, since the bottle of red brandy I bought earlier still had much left in it. When I caught sight of those shining eyes as I looked round, even through the cover-glass, I felt afraid, yet delighted, that one snatched it from under the door and passed over my head. My heart beat swiftly and my breath quickened suddenly. I was out of breath. I rose hastily. “What!” exclaimed I to myself; “I can not sleep no longer.” As soon as I saw how fast I was running, I thought,” How I wish I had caught the man who slipped into my pocket before I got the faucet I wanted!” After some hesitation I admit that I felt nervous as well, though I did not know that. I could not believe my eyes when I felt a hand on my arm. “A man is stumbling at your door,” said the voice. “Well, you must make haste. You can catch him at last."

988,"when he suddenly started weeping bitterly. “I thought we were going to have an _eating-pot_ dinner!” said he. “But I'm sorry for everybody else, for my dear wife wants to go out.; shall I be married, then?” he cried; as if dying he would say: “Yes, wedding-day; yes, it is my time to die.: no more merry talk in my head, just let me marry!” And he pushed the fire into the table and set down his glass. The poor man was very sorry. In the morning he knocked at his door. When he arrived he said: “Will you turn the lamp on, lady, while I go downstairs?” Then the servant answered: “We have not anything better to do for supper.” The poor man wished that he had not been so clever and that he had lived much longer; but he had not long to waste away. He has never tried a very hard bed, he only slept for a day and evening, and on every night there was something new for him. He thought it the truth that in so doing he did not feel the desire for all that people's nice things were useful. In his last days the man has not lost sight of that he loved himself most. It is his work which makes him miserable. He has fallen in love, though he never said so aloud. His nights he walks about out of the sun, without anybody there to watch him. All you want, pretty little Maturin!” says he, with a pointed gesture, yet smiling mysteriously when he spoke: “Have you a good play now?” and he puts his arms round her and rests the hand upon her breast. In the evening he lifts up his watch. He picked it up and went to lay out the music. But the second hand, resting on his breast, signals to him. “Only stay at home and don'thing of it,” thought he to himself, trying, however very gently, to take his clock from his lap. He felt that he must give this message a present. Indeed, the second hand struck on a piece of paper. “That s true; now, get in the saddle too,” said the cordovan. And the first note sang: “Hold me fast, Laura.: Only stay at home and don'thing of it,” put it on the horse-hair pole, and the riders were on their way, thinking that it was the last he heard of him."
989,"' Snigdha had bought some chocolates at the local supermarket. It was a rare sight. Most people would have given anything for one, especially if she could get it at such a price. But her family was poor and she had not used all her money to buy much more than a few dozen of them. She didn't know how to make the most out of it, but thought it worth the try. ` My wife is very clever!' she thought; and rubbed her fingers together to try to bring her own thoughts together in order to help her to think of something else. ` Yes, my dear husband,'she said, ` my wife is clever; take me through your favourite sport and entertainment, so like your sister. Yes; you might say it is a bit dull, but it will entertain you as well as any amusement I can give you.' The food and the games which they played are given by themselves now, and you will notice how tiny and insignificant are they compared to what Mrs. Smith does to amuse herself. Well, at last she came on to see what her sharp tongue could do. Now her teeth, hard as nails, were nothing enough to catch a glimpse of any objects, but she felt curious about more subtle things, and made inquiries by tapping on an object to see how it behaved under the tap. In a moment she was back in her shop, though if one of her neighbours suddenly boomed a complaint that the pies from St. James's ( Mrs. Smith's ) store were too high their heads immediately exploded. Though the pie was certainly very good, and very delicious, the very very long thin white slices were soiled very quickly that hardly anyone noticed the error of their ways. There, just where she expected them to be, was standing a little fire, as we have already said, where someone now at least wanted to try out the wood fire, for he remembered that there were three pies in it already. He looked round and saw the two pies lying on the table with muddy spoons, the one on the right had its spout running very close to the fire-place, the other remained at full capacity and never touched the fire till it caught a bit of smoke from the chimney. Well, then, what was to be done?' asked the old woman with the sharp teeth.' That, my dear wife, must be for our sake,'and as if by magic power, something happened that seemed quite impossible. There were traces of oil everywhere, but it seemed she couldn't use it, or the tannoy would have put it off, which, before this incident, she often found herself doing. The scene drew near that the man who knew everything at his store would presently learn to run away -- no, to walk without hearing. Then, in spite of his efforts, he soon reached the far end of the garden, where it is, and walked up the beautiful mountain path which was a dead giveaway for anyone with cunning enough to look for it, and like others, moved along as best he could. Thus far he did not seem able to gain any ground but with excuses when he noticed who was leading him, in those parts so frequented by thieves and wild beasts, and their braceings of stones; and so lame he seemed while near, and seeing a fellow who was pointing with his dagger, stole off and hid himself in a hollow of a tree. Not long after, the youngest son of the elder three entered his father's house, knowing quite well what his parents had planned for him. Here, as it turned out, the play was over before it started."

'That's something I must do,'you acknowledge, waggling your hands in an extremely rehearsed gesture.

Is there anything I can do?''To stop the planned genocide.” defend your Earth.” I will die defending your so called Home.' The father breathes his last."
991,"' and so forth. But in no one's got enough for him yet. Down came again the third trumpet from under the mountain. They heard a great heap of black smoke rise from it; then down came in a blaze such hailstones as had never been seen -- seven hundred and eighty thousand of them! The earth shook with the blasts, and the mountains were hewn up. Beneath they lay Pequeninos, giants strong, huge, good-natured giantesses. And their children too were very fine-looking -- Queequeg, or the Red Man, tiny fat fellow. To look upon their thick skins fitted them handsomely, showing well put on their very rugged feet -- their long locks by their shoulders bound the ground with trappings of bright gold and precious stones, round their necks their horses were trained, bearing baskets made of soft grass and rolling brooks. To ride up on those legs of theirs is no small task, they had to hoist the horses up dead right, because their fathers gave order that the tallest of them should seize his crown right off, and bring it back once a week. Everybody liked Pequeninos, for she was the prettiest girl, and as a humble excuse for poorness the girl most acceptable amongst her kind was the only well-dressed member of the house at dinner. But nobody expected anything more than what happened next: for eight weeks he rode to battle where neither man nor beast alive came, but he had enjoyed their company admirably, holding back the plague on their hind legs and keeping the wild beasts in underfoot so well that no enemy could become the prize. Then, to look out for brave fights on both sides, Pequeninos prepared for them dresses of jasper and diamonds and emerald; and to rouse spirits round her they collected the hunters and herdsmen. Before everyone could console themselves over how fortunate they had been for their heros, by the last buzzer sounded the fourth trumpet, and every tree in the hillside shrank, every flower, root, branch or leaf fell off, and all returned beneath the rocks of the forest. Once there stood a girl, like the other girls before it, so lovely but sad, and her cheeks now turned red and sparkling like tears in the old world, and bright sparkles on her beautiful face, and on her wrinkled brow there hung strings from twined calico string. ` Oh!' cried the second girl, ` tell me all! When were you born?' ` Ay, late in my gallant youth, that was all I ever dared say,'replied the first. ` How did you get into these clumps of sticks and trees, to build such wonderful walls, that you could not defeat the Giant Pequeninos when once in them?' ` Ah, it was no trick,'answered Pequeninos peevishly, ` I set them to their work, and myself led the defence ;'and ` By the way, children, you know not what dangers are in these wood-covered forests. They climb over tall walls, hide themselves in underbrush, jump down a deep pit, cut off a snake's head and hang its tail about their neck; and in short, you may easily see they have nothing more splendid than to slice up men and rape women in their sleep.' ` Yes,, I would not think they would be so wicked,'said the second girl presently. ` See if you can say anything to make them listen to us.' ` Well, well, how couldn't they stop till we dragged them up the small golden stairs to make our escape from the forest?' said the third lady at last."
992,"'she smiles at you, We see it all the time.” I laugh. 'she says, This year my dad introduced me to this girl. 'You're all confused right?'You ask, Do I have to tell you everything right away. 'Since you aren't reading what we said at dinner. '... How is the little girl in white sitting up there staring at you like some sort of movie star? '... thinking she looks too good, she yells something. 'I hear her scream. '... getting closer. '... making a bubble, makes the sound of screaming. 'Yes, yes, those sounds. '...

993,"''You have to listen to him, Death needs you.” YOU HAVE TO!' I 'LL MAKE IT CLEAN!' 'WE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT YOU!' Death!' I can't live without you.' When she finished her speech, there was a knock on the door.' She said.' Death is angry with us.' Yes, he is.' ` He wants our daughter as his mistress?'' It is all right!' said the rich young woman.' I had a lovely dream.' Death then told her what it was about.' I know.' But Death found no pleasure in telling these things.' Oh, you daren t tell him.' said Death. ` All he wants is us as wives for our children.' It was all well for a few minutes. Then, when he returned home, he found his son still asleep. ` What have you done?' asked Death.' I had no idea.” Look here!' he cried, pointing to the floor. ` If I were given all the wealth on earth,'answered his son, who was no longer yet three years old, ` why should I care which government I run in?'' I will not give it up!' he kept repeating, thinking of how all the people would never want me when they died.' How do you mean, what should I give up?' ` If they knew what I could do, they would want me to kill them as soon as possible.' Now there were a lot of evil people in the world.” Yes, I know.' ` And you can do anything?'' Not quite, but that does not make me crazy.' ` Well, give me patience."
994,"'] explained the house's owner.' I am all-too familiar with that dreadful spot in the garden between Acacia and Pillars of Flame.' Then he curled his scarlet beard which was growing rather bushy, and said ` Dear Hunter ', for he knew that unless the fight with the monsters was long enough, he would be turned to stone.' And when the princess saw him she thought that if he only found a sword and rode away on it, he might not get killed.' So the hunter sat down again with a great wine cup, put on some stony armour, and rode away as fast as possible. He reached the place where the monsters were standing, but they had just struck at him and then returned with the sword, so that he looked about him no more, but even took off part of his shirt to hide the mark he had made. When he got near the other side of the valley he rode slowly to the edge of the cliff. ` Where is the monster?' asked the horse that lay behind him; but the moment the sword came round to its target, the beast sprang out and carried off the rider. The queen was frightened when she heard of it, and throwing herself on her knees, saved that prince's life for a little while. At last she came up to a tree, by the roots torn up by the monster, when the lightning ran so high and bright that all else melted away.' Ah! what dreadful thing was that? And who was at it?' cried ` We are only servants'; and the beggar gave her some water till she recovered from her shock; and she looked round and saw the mountain where the only two men remained alive in the fight. She rushed towards them, where all four were dead, except that the giantess was crouching weeping, and that maidens just like their sisters bore them tresspipes on the back and neck. But the first it grew hot, and soon there was fire flying so high that nobody could stand still. Oh, it was dreadful!' she whispered to her brother and sister, while the king was running towards the monster from which the spears landed. Meanwhile they told the king what had happened. Then they set out to search for a ship that carried them far away in a night. But when they reached the island their boat broke into three parts; one floated on the shore, there was the second which went in the water, and the third passed over clouds. They were trying to follow this boat now, but every day they had to stay nearer to the coast, and at the end of the week there was a fine storm; they were all dirty and hungry in the moonlight, and wept bitterly from their disappointment and thirst, and the poor maidens were instead thinking how difficult it was to manage even to walk on the grass among all the corn and sago plants with the woolen stockings dangling upon their head like cords. Now it happened that they wanted to get a dinner to-morrow for themselves and their father and his daughter, and butler as well, as those young women were talking talkative from grief.' she said to them, ` It has been many years since our friends sought for us and left the house, so it must have seemed very long before we had the time to go out, or perhaps they did not expect to come home.' But the horses galloped past the island on which they sat eating potatoes.' I wonder who it may have been,'said the maidens. ` Yes, who?' ` We are ashamed to tell you,'answered the eldest, ` but I have seen many strange things in the garden and don't know that the man who brings us food sometimes turns away from us to go hunt with the giants in the dark.' The day went by, and every night the hunting took on. ` What was the story that spurred this on?' ` A letter from your father' asked the messenger.”' he answered."

1002,"As you see, it's a difficult fight.” After some long weeks the battle is won; but they are over lost in their thoughts as much as in their wounds. The snow-bound stranger says to them: “We have been hardy in our new friends, so we can not blame ourselves if we fall into the enemy's hands again, yet should not you let us die and rest in peace?” But they mean well and end by forgiving the stranger and his companions. This time the two troops, seeing their comrade's graces, set about begging for mercy and friendship from their friend, and a feasting was given in their honour. They were greatly pleased, and as they had already fattened the stomachs of many prisoners before the winter was over the winter had not frozen nor the frost yet worn off. So the comrades were warmed up by the charity their friend had shown them. When they heard that their comrade, the one they had tried to kill by killing him with a poisoned dart, was about to escape they beat on one another mercilessly and with all their might, till at last they saw their friend start with great strides across the battlefield after each rush with the bough down. He halted at some watering-place amongst the trees that passed under the enemy's lines. It used to fall suddenly on the two leaders which pierced the stiff rock and blew against each other. When they saw the path he was going through and the palmet to be cut in half some running ran to warn the next to come along, and the man who came first understood what had happened. ` You would lose your life to save my own!' shouted the leader of the second troop. But when he perceived that he knew quite well that he and none other could survive the struggle it began to seem pretty clear that no harm should be done to him and that no one else could either. From that moment they grew more suspicious of each other, dreading what might happen if they crossed swords again, and several times, when the enemy seemed advancing toward the tree which led to the hut, the count vowed to do what his friend would to help him. In due course that resulted in an offer which both parties felt was very sweet indeed, but both could never refuse, for it comes easily to nobody, and in fact there is none except their cause and theirs who go to death with one blow. Whilst they were talking, the second man seized a staff, from a trunk on the stump, and thrust the straw as high as he could into the neck of the third man, so that his head shook. In this manner, by lifting each other's arms and hanging them from branches to avoid touching, they succeeded all day at making an attempt to cut off the other's head. Both men swore silently, kept their feet always on the ground, while they went in pursuit of the winner, perhaps getting only lucky strikes which had no effect. Sometimes, however, they could win out; they were both sweating blood as soon as they could cover a distance without falling. By-and-by, however, they got through the wood with their companions in their force almost smitten with death. Then it happened as fate did not to start any sooner than it did in practice, but they had crossed the field of foes. Their enemy galloped out by some unknown manner, only stopping to swing himself along the body of an old soldier lying dead close to them with long thirst. Now the young man knew that his task would be extremely difficult if the enemy were strong enough, but if not, he thought to ride behind and see what news came of him. So he took off his hat and put on his sword, and when the enemy saw the bands that watched him try to batter their leader so loudly that their ears rang like a sore drum, he was gone. It is a fine story that a flag-waving kerchief from a beggar's home is followed by the head, armed and riding a chariot set out among their stout army, while another is a chieftain, but there can you tell me who exactly why this?' Just then, I think he knows the spade he came and he must be both must do it.' But I hope that he certainly is one. And be sure he brought about to know what! For over night he rode a dwarf, for there came a tiger, too; but you were running, but where they of what, that still there is very, or at worst."

King Charles concluded: ` There you have the problem.' The king was really curious.' I must see him.' So he entered the room, with the magician, and the reception was over with its usual splendour. Everybody dressed themselves. Everybody tried on something else; and then King Charles came out, looking quite amazed at his own wonder-working skills. “Oh, sir!” he exclaimed, “that is just what I expected! I could not believe myself able to do that. No matter how much I sought I could not catch him! Well, good-day, father; you ought to be glad, if that is all.” But the prince did not, indeed he had no idea that what he said was true. “Yes, you are right,” he thought; “but why should I look so foolish?” And when the battle was over, he thought, as he stood there alone in the dreadful arena of death, “I am much better off without you. This is a pretty cold place where there are no other men.” So they would have nothing more to say about it to the other princes -LRB- their sons -RRB- and only began talking about other things after they were gone. “It is but common sense to give her a lesson when she has learned too little.” said King Ludwig to his son Ludwig. “That does seem rather more difficult than it sounds,” answered his mother. “Truly, if there were only four heads to rule her whole kingdom, she would have very little chance against a horde of robbers that hunted every one in a thousand miles round!” In fact, no sooner had the fear passed through Ludwig's mind than he found himself feeling quite better. He got up from his seat in one of his splendid robes, went to his room and found an ample supply of anything he wanted to eat. He soon started for home, not knowing how things should have ended. For, though he was very tired, all he could do to prevent himself being hurt was to dream his way back to King Ludwig. King Ludwig only felt quite content with the gold and jewels which he had acquired in the fight, and left Queen Maria close at hand for exchange, and very richly pleased to be rid of her ungrateful baby. Prince Ludwig spent a great part of the winter trying to discover his courage; and though he longed to go out and take part in some armed battles, he was not so strong minded as a lion or a bear to stay by the side of wolves or bears, not even with pussies."

But a sudden good feeling seized his heart. ` Give me my letter, or run,'said the Dwarf, moving towards the centre of the room. And, indeed, there was nothing you did not promise. -LCB- On the Site of Death: p149. jpg -RCB- As they stood together and both received their letters with joy, Didr glanced sadly at the wretched scribe and remembered. At his knees he clutched the paper tightly so that neither his eyes nor the light on his head could read what it said. One moment more, perhaps, might have been too long, and then the tears would have rolled down his cheeks. Then, the smile on his sad face changed to an angry frown. There was nothing but despair in his eyes and his body filled with cold and sadness. And as one, the men and women slowly drew near to him. A few spoke, but how many others were silent or would not answer? Still more! Why had not the human world united in one spirit not once, while Sojourners have walked to great distant shores till only recently, how many thousands of years it has stretched, from our arrival on that new planet only to our parting and reunion! No sooner had the letters arrived in each other than the battles resumed.

1026,"At the top of the hill he hears a voice whisper.' ` The king begs you to think what are you doing,'says he, ` but you have not so much as a hair in your head. Walk in peace back to your kingdom; that is wisely said,'and the shadow goes away. There is only his sword, though its blade is thicker than a earthen pot. As it cleaves this sword -- no one else will have it, except.' Before anyone answers he prepares some bread, and as he takes a deep draught from a honeycomb, he seizes up the last three drops. He holds out the drop for the man, who thrusts it into his mouth with a look of great astonishment. This indeed broke open quite suddenly, but, unhappily, the drop soon lost itself, owing to the thirst caused by the food it contained. ` Don't make this any worse than ever,'says the knight to him in that agony. And the other might well be urged into this kind of action, for then the Prince would naturally see that it was useless try so hard to be virtuous. By-and-by the creepers were loosened, and when it had been an instant the person handed the king his fair apple. And how glad he was to find it! When he found that he had got what he wanted he very calmly dropped the gold into the hut of the giant. Then, lowering down and taking out something more good than twice the amount, he laid it on the ground. For a few minutes he wondered where it all ended, but the moment he felt a steady beating on his heels he scrambled forward, snatched the apple from his hand, and carried it away as fast as he could. -LSB- Illustration: Page 17 -RSB- Farewell Madam The Elf and the Dwarf As soon as the little shopkeeper saw how foolish and indifferent she was, he threw herself at her feet in joy, and requested her forgiveness for all the bad things she had done. He thanked her, took off her hat which she wore as a woman, knelt beside her, and kissed her face. She gave him leave to kiss again; then they kissed each other every day, and the one who kissed most often became the fairy. They did not remain friends for long, and on their wedding night the elder grew old, and the girl wished she had lived ten years longer. Now the story concerns a young dwarf who was so foolish and inconsiderate that he thought he could steal golden apples from two giants who had fallen asleep, nor even approach the house. However, the wisest and gentlest boy happened to know that this was not so easy. He ordered them to be set upon the spot, and put a third of each apple inside the bodies of the men in white robes, with white bonnets round their necks, as if they had slept but yesterday. They must have stopped some time to drink, and surely the water should have chilled them to death, had not the youngest one of the men who was cooking the frogs made some noise, much louder than before, and spouted a faint rustling of bread, which covered the inn from the top. ` What nonsense you are speaking, poor boy?' asked the magician who had carried the apple from one giant to another. ` Well, you may have but one chance. You are to carry the half full apple in your left hand, while still holding the fingers out of the tip. But where is the fire going to? Just hold the tip out and let it burn out with the magic ball."

But before she could do any such deed, she heard a voice crying from the other side of the hall: ` Unseen enemy! my well-wishers; save your unhallowed heart! Let our queen who rules over all hearts be set free to her own destiny.' Then Liz seized her right hand and guided her back to Namaadu. Then again Liz forgot her sorrow, for she had never liked her sister enough. But when she heard her brother's name again, she remembered what she had said about Namaadu. ` Your master wishes to marry you,'said she at last.

Heywood, several excellent poultrymen, Mr. Alfred Phelan, and Hugh Barrett, the savvy manager.' I thought that would be enough for the usual AIP service. The usual report took place: our characters had served eight sushi rolls at Shogi Hamarei, and their summaries were as charming as any coffee table book.' I think not.' But it's some _Hogwarts_ Incorporated_ chap called Stanley Marsh who does the actual business.' What about McNeill Bros.' The Judge fixed them out of town. As for Your Royal Highness, we made an annual profit of £15,000.' Oh, at least they kept your cheque.' But the Americans never came to my country!' -- Poor Reginald.' The verdict was unanimous.' I would leave this matter to the French.' I have everything in writing.' She stood up.' I am going to France.' Yes, she went before I could protest.' You shall come with me.' She left. Before she left they were married in a French way church, where the wedding altar was covered with flowers and all the clotted rose water should have gone down to the ground."

Well, there's a small boy, who doesn't speak English, and everybody in the family do's just look at him like he's a freak and expect him to take off his shirt and things.' Well, that's easy.' said Arjun, coming to the window.' I see nothing, but I will look.' Then he peered in. There was a little boy wearing shorts; he had long white hair that made his face rather flat, his reddish skin had become yellow and blotchy, and he had a black afro running round his neck.' I think the person you saw last played bridge, or something.' repeated the little child.' That is perfectly normal,'answered Arjun.' And for all the world I enjoy swimming.' Then the girl became more astonished, as she had heard stories about the days when walking was a sport.' I will show you!' said she.' I will hold up my hand and let go!' As soon as the boy touched her hand she kissed him tenderly, and ran to run downstairs to her room."

1042,"I suppose the question was cute, but I don t think that is where the problem lies.' The reason I write is for my family.' A troll asked, ` What a little girl you are!' ` Dear me,'replied he, ` and besides I am afraid to come near you.' ` It will not be so bad if you ask me,'said she hastily; ` you shall soon see,'and went away quietly. Well, after breakfast she returned to the cave, and said to herself: ` Oh, if only I were in your place. Why would I refuse to have what I want?'' It is very bad that I have never written a word.' ` At least you had better go back home.' And with another burst of laughter, she ran out, lost almost without noticing her pace. Down at the bottom, there stood a white grave, but for some time she forgot her husband and her terrible sorrows, and wandered down to the well of the lake. But now she remembered her crying, when her father brought her up, and to this day she sings softly to herself from that sorrowful river. ` Her mother's tears have stopped, and she is all alone in the grave.' Then she paused in the water and sang softly; and at last she came out into the sunshine, holding up her head. ` Oh, if only she were here! If only they had understood me, she must have been found before me; and I should know why.' And it happened that in one street the twelve-year old walked up, tied up his horse to the chimney, while she played with beads and knickknacks in the park below. He never looked at her again, and no fairy ever took her to hide even on the moor, where he knew he could never expect to find her. ` Alas! if only I were here. Alas!' she thought: ` what must I tell them, where she must be?' And up and down she strewed her parcel to wild flowers, hoping in a moment that the noonday sun might give her fair relief, and bring back her long lost daughter; but soon they looked and saw that no mist came over the yellow marble lawns of the palace, nor waters rose through the gaps between branches, and they stole away into the forest, where it was easy to get to her window, so that they were hidden by the grass beneath the heads of polite people, much too bright for her eyes. Suddenly the princess turned on the horn of her singing-trumpet and made several cries, which did not reach the ears of the eldest princess. Then the other seemed to reach for her, and threw all her gifts to the young man, who stepped back as the last came on. ` Ah, what a sad state our little sister is in, very sad indeed. Has anything happened that may divert us a little?' asked she. Yes, she has left everything to me, she says; quite alone, but I can manage to keep her under guard.” And I will. Suppose I do take care of you. When you come here in three days time you will find them suddenly broken up as if the most horrible heartbreak ever dreamed it happened -- for I will take care to keep quiet."

1044,"' ` What a pleasure, to say the least!' said his bridegroom who seemed rather astonished at this manner of giving, though he was not altogether deaf to cries and groans from his slaves, who kept up the order. He thought that perhaps with so many wives it might have been the means of a few, but she had as many children as ever before, and they gave them as much milk as they wanted as soon as he came in. At first they were very angry at this, but everything changed to talk and exchange, and a mother began to see how curious it was when on one occasion her baby-boy had an idea of what should be done for bread and cheese, and this she did after he reached a little distance from them. Then they cut long cuts into a big pot. And as the boy hadn't cut near enough the big hole, or else they would have split it open, and have lost everything, and lived quite justly till they returned to their own family; for otherwise they would say, ` We did well, we found new husbands.' And then there comes a time when all children become spoiled enough to know that their parents don't deserve them. If their father wants something back it is quite easy for him to make his slaves go to the butcher and cut some pieces of meat into small bits, and when he gets what they want the next morning he sends them off with some message to tell their new husbands, ` You shall never be given anything.' One day the new wife and son passed through the town on their way home to their home in another part of Greece. The sons made an offer to sell their virginity to be married to the most beautiful women, while the daughter refused, but neither of them would much care about going back, for she was tired and could not think of much to see in Greece. They turned from their home at nightfall, and looking out from one window they saw a dog leading a horse along the road, carrying among it some precious money, one foot beneath his thong. The son wondered, and offered to give it back to the dog, who, having taken off its coat, put it on his back as fast as he could, and left the house. As they always promised, after a few days some fine pieces of gold were brought down to the thinnest point in a cave where the dogs could never find it again. In, or near by, there stood a heap of stones and toots of cattle, and there were millions more in it; but there was no way to get to it. Soon the father remembered what he had said, and he remembered his promise. With a stroke of the wand he opened up the caves in every direction, and which didn t seem the proper place to ask the luckiest and holiest young man to bring his jewels. His eyes grew sad as he listened to the strange noises that were heard through such holes, and he feared what would happen when the slave took away the jewels. Well, he hung up his jewels in a box and went in. When he entered the hall there was so loud music that all the windows in the palace burst through, and so great a noise of trumpets and clangs that his bridegrooms fancied they saw torches marching in front of the gate. His parents were trying to stop him, but every woman in the court threw herself on him, crying out: ` There is your treasure, my lovely son. Look! golden tresses shall fall in a heap at once!' For a moment the judge wondered what made her cry like that, and wondering what could explain it, so he shook her gently and went on. Suddenly, walking towards her, the child clasped his hands tight together: ` You may not take anything away, love.' She cried with tears flowing down her cheeks: ` Come! tell me what you mean!' The judge turned away, looking with an ugly face, and presently went up to a spot where he saw the treasure lying crushed into dust. At this sight his eyes sunk into his beard, and, which the king looked down again and stared down. ` My dear son,'Good heavens,'he cried; I have plenty!'m a brother there was there, your good quality for my valentress!'He will see all three slaps and all to bring me.' I must go home!'-- they are fine!'- let me!'added his kneads never took the treasure you '. 'What is there!'As he says, he begged."

1046,", or seeing it. But this is not so easy as some imaginations might think it is; many understand that all the spells from other books are in other wizards's sets, but where wizards stop quarrelling over which books they should start with, muggles are squabbling over which books to start with, and can bring only one set of magical laws at a time. Even buying a new book to begin with will not help much - you see, the bits and pieces, everywhere is making them. How to make a magic wand? Try this, if you can make it last forever.' The look of horror on Hermione's face caused the barkeep to exclaim in pain. ` Do not help!' she cried. Just stand where you are!' The muggle was rather shocked by the idea; how can he do that! However, he rubbed a sleep over his eyes and hurried out to try. He stopped when he reached a small dusty room and looked out across the street; the door was open. Now a whole crowd had gathered round the shop to see what was going on. ` We have all gone mad and lost our wands,'he exclaimed as he swept out his wand. They were all very angry, when a wizard opened the door in front of them.' I can not find any magic wand anywhere.' Well, what do we say?' asked the young girl.' If I sell this magic sword, I shall really be able to have one for my wife and two for myself. It did not take a moment to talk to the newsboy, who recommended the old rascal.' I am not ready yet!' he shouted, hoisting up the sword on his shoulders. ` Don't fight for things! Maybe this book might help!' cried a crying muggle. ` Oh, how nice and complicated it would be,'he thought to himself."

1049,"'When the student was finished, he looked up and smiled sheepishly at the teacher across from him. ` Good bye Professor,'said the student. The teacher bowed politely to his student, and leaving them to themselves, they walked back down the stairs and to their rooms. After dinner they dined together with their friend, who was a great deal prettier than usual. As he sat there, he heard no one eat, and not a piece of meat to be had for dinner. All he wanted was a nice nice fresh steak cooked very slowly to taste. But when he touched it with his finger to see whether it was just right or not,, the poor steak grew stiff and cold at the touch of his finger. He took out the hair, put it in his mouth, and made a pretty big croquette from it. Well, of course a small piece would hardly make much of a croquette, so when the hair returned and touched his finger, it grew even smaller and weaker. ` Suppose it grew stiff again without my help?' asked he, ` on which condition shall I let it go?' And the hairs began still growing and shrank even more slowly till there was scarcely anything left of them at all. Then the teacher summoned a fine lad with several faces, black as night, with a long beard standing right before him, his head for an oyster oyster. And he planted a small pear about the body and brought it up to the school boy. “You shall not have it if you fail so far.” cried the Oyster-Master; but the first with tears went still lower than the last. By the second try his crab ran on. By the third try his spark grew faint, and when he tried to reach the oyster his arm was twitching like thunder. Then he made a right pirouette from the shell, and got away at once. “See, my son!” cried the Oy-Master. “That means your little crab will soon wither, as little crabs do in a twinkling. Now take this crab and give it up, and save up your treasure; if the crab dies, we shall get what we want first.” With these words the oyster was prepared and laid it out, ready by the Oyster-Masters. This done, there appeared in front of the crab's shell its shell and intestine, and behold! on it was writ red a sort of mark as a wolf's fur, and that looked like blood: and the plate broke upon it and it fell down into the ocean where it could not recover itself. The crabs were gathered together together one after another and taken back to the school. They thought the signs were nothing and wondered still more than before, as how anyone could tell when a big white cloud of purple smoke will suddenly appear and be what you promised them. The next morning a brave man came to the school carrying a big salmon from a great lake that is sheltered by mountains on both sides and offers splendid fish for sale. When they saw the salmon they got quite frightened and made to flee as fast as they could."

This claim is based mostly off of a quote by Richard Wagner's symphony composer, Beethoven, to which both Wuthering Heights and Puliade belong. But I can vouch for this claim being utterly baseless: the original quotation was in fact from a chess match conducted by Italian mover and ambassador Gratiano (Italian: ''Gratide'') and not from Baudelaire's Madame Bovary. And I think it's fair to say that Wagner no longer intended for Bovary to appear in his orchestral work Die Nibelungenlied. On the contrary, there is considerable evidence to suggest that Wagner wrote Beethoven's Ninth in only an evening and that there is some truth to any suggestion that Wagner used the story of a nuclear war between Germany and France as inspiration for his opera.

1051,"' I want no more.' she cried, tossing her cloak round her.' Yes, I don't mind if you gave me an order for ten pence to eat one of my young men -- but I will give you only one pence to sleep with me -- and that is enough. You must make up your minds so that I may be able to go back to the other side.' “Nonsense!” answered Ricardo, who did not know what sort of woman he had been speaking against -- nor could she remember him being there at all, because she was so very tired. But as the girl explained it to him, he understood her too well to be outdone. ` Oh, you can have my child, yes, I mean -- she is the fairest baby, and that is all I care about at all -- but in the end she shall take the best place in the family. Now do as you see fit.' With these words she withdrew her handkerchief; the farmer rose early in the morning, and bound her upon his shoulder. With his father's permission, he told a few stories to the woman, as, in spite of all her wealth, she possessed nothing of use to anyone. How she has grown fond of him, how fond she has become of herself, and how she never knew a nice, patient woman not better than herself, is the story he said he would tell. She laid on her the richest jewels and jewelry-encrusted silks; every drop of goodness sold for ten per penny -- yet what the poor young man and younger son did was nothing in comparison with what she spent for this curiosity; for on the wane of ninety, she gathered so much treasure up in two bags for herself that her son also with the money could get just enough to carry home the rest, and thus finish his education and the business of toiling in cotton mills. To add to the horror of this scene -- which must not frighten them very much -- there struck the fellow by accident at the door not far from where he had strolled with his wife one fine day when she had got her first husband; and his heart sank and dropped out of his throat. ` Why isn't your sister here?' inquired she gravely as she lifted the curtain to show her as one of those beggars who lived in the streets. ` Surelyn't. And why are they standing up so soon?' ` I didn't think that I should be,'was the reply. ` Just wait awhile, and then I might get your help again. Here are three sacks of flour which you have brought from the mill, hold the little boy, and shut him up up in there!' So the time for supper drew near.' I saw that all was lost before I put out the fire and set it at our hearth,'said the girl as the noise died away, smiling faintly at the priest.' My brothers have been telling me,'she added, bending down to pick up the little bran-stone the poor man had thrown under the table.' It would not have burnt so bright if that he were not made of white sheep-fur; you need not worry about that.' So tying the goat on the same cords that hang above the fire made her appear for ever so modest. Then the old queen was taken in to sit beside her, and by turning the knob which opened that double door she locked up the priest so securely, that in six weeks she and the girl had their own way back to India. What she thought and what she did neither of theirs at this day is known to us. Even now, though many people live to old age without knowing it, this mystery is not altogether unknown to most of them. They think about whom they are dying for and how the first step toward death is to die by the sword."
