    "conversation": "AI: The year is 1777 Joseph is a citizen living in London. One day, he receives a mysterious letter from a stranger. The letter contains a riddle that leads him to a hidden treasure in the city. Joseph embarks on an adventure to solve the riddle and find the treasure, encountering various challenges and characters along the way. He learns about the history of London and uncovers secrets about his own family.\nUser: Joseph first decide to travel to Paris",
    "reasoning": "1. **Objects and Constants**: We need to define the main objects in the story: Joseph, London, Paris, the mysterious letter, the stranger, and the hidden treasure. These will be constants of type Object.\n2. **Relations**:\n   - `is_citizen (Object, Object) Bool`: Joseph is a citizen of London. This is an exclusive relation because Joseph can't be a citizen of two places at the same time.\n   - `receives (Object, Object, Int) Bool`: Joseph receives the letter from the stranger at time T0. This is a time-constrained relation because the act of receiving happens at a specific time.\n   - `locates_in (Object, Object, Int) Bool`: Joseph is in London at T0 and then moves to Paris at T1. This is a time-constrained exclusive relation because Joseph can't be in two places at the same time.\n3. **Time Constants**: We need to define T0 (present at the beginning) and T1 (new present after Joseph decides to travel to Paris).",
    "formula": "(ast-vector\n  (is_citizen Joseph London)\n  (forall ((x Object)) (=> (not (= x London)) (not (is_citizen Joseph x))))\n  (receives Joseph mysterious_letter T0)\n  (locates_in Joseph London T0)\n  (locates_in Joseph Paris T1)\n  (forall ((x Object) (t Int))\n    (=> (and (locates_in Joseph x t) (not (= x Paris)))\n        (not (locates_in Joseph Paris t)))))",
