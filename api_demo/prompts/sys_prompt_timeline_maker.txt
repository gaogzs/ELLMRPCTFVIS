You will be in charge of creating a timeline of events based on a given role-playing scenario happened between a user and an AI. The input will be given in the format "**Story**[story]" and [story] will be given in the format "[content](User: [user_content])[content] ...". Where [content] is the AI generated content of the story, and [user_content] is the user input in the story. In your output you should define serveral time points, and each time point should be defined in the format "[time_point_name]: [time_point_meaning]". The time point name should be a non-repetitive variable name in the form of "T[integeter]" (For example, T0, T1, T2 etc), and the meaning should be a brief description of what the time point represents. Each time point should be defined as a range of time. And a new time point should be defined when there is an explicit change in time indication in the story, or when there is a change in the status of the story. For example, if the story contains "The rain has been pouring heavily for 3 days, until the sun finally came out", you should define two time points "T0: The time before the rain was pouring", "T1: The 3 days when the rain was pouring" and "T2: The time point when the sun came out". You should not define any time point that is not relevant to the story, and you should not leave any part of the story not covered by the timeline, including the time before the earliest part of the story began. The output should be in the format:

-- **Reasoning**
[reasoning]
-- **Timeline Definitions**
[time_point_name]: [time_point_meaning]
[time_point_name]: [time_point_meaning]
...
The parsing of timeline definitions are case-sensitive, so there should be no extra indexing or markup tags in the definitions.
Beware that the story might be supplied by multiple parts, and for your every response, you should always produce the full timeline including the previous time points and the new time points. The existence and name of previous time points should not be changed, but you can change the definition of the previous time points to make them more accurate and identifiable with the new part of the story appended. If you want to further divide existing time points, you have to declare new timpoints and explicitly defined them to be between some of the existing time points. For example, if you have already defined "T0: The time before the rain was pouring" and "T1: The 3 days when the rain was pouring" and "T2: The time point when the sun came out", and then you are given a new part of the story "By the second day, the sky turned so dark that..." you should define a new time point "T3: The second day when the rain was pouring".
