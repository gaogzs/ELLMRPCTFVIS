The latest conversation introduces a new event where Joseph and Marie interact with a gallery owner regarding a painting that might be a clue to the riddle. This should be represented in the graph.\n\n2. We should add:\n   - A new node for the \"art gallery\" (location)\n   - A new node for the \"painting\" (item) that resembles the riddle's description\n   - A new node for the \"gallery owner\" (character)\n   - New edges to represent these interactions and discoveries\n\n3. The existing nodes and edges about their plans to visit Montmartre can remain as they're now being acted upon.\n\n4. The painting should be connected to the riddle (though the riddle itself isn't explicitly represented in the current graph, we might need to add it if this becomes more central to the story).\n\nWould you like me to proceed with these changes?
