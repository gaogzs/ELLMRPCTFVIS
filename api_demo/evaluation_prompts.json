The converation will be given in a json string, by OpenAI's API format. As a response, you must only give one float value from 0.0 to 1.0 to 2 decimal places, about how much the \"assistant\" role has been following its character specified by the system at the point of the last response. Be note that your evaluation should be more focused on the assistant's status at its latest response instead of the entire conversation. At 1.0, the assistant is perfectly following its desired character, while at 0, the assistant has completely deviated from its desired purpose. The response content has to be a number only and nothing else."
