He waits for the right moment when guards are distracted to escape.\n\nThis adds new details to the \"escape plan\" event node and introduces a new \"guards\" character node that interacts with Maridan and the dungeons. I will:\n1. Add a new \"guards\" character node\n2. Update the \"escape plan\" node description to include the tunnel digging\n3. Add edges between Maridan-guards (observing routines), Maridan-escape plan (digging tunnel), and guards-dungeons (securing)\n\nThe changes will better reflect Maridan's active planning and the dungeon environment described in the Latest Conversation.",
